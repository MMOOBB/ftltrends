Remember how the first few hours yesterday nobody actually did anything, they just kind of stood around and stared at the wall? The entire point of reality shows is the interactions between contestants, conversations, drama, conflict, and so on. If no one's talking or if everyone is just together blandly gossiping in one group = boring. If this was an actual reality TV show with an elimination per week, there should be little factions forming by now with drama over who will be the first out. There was almost a little hint of this starting yesterday with the bed conversations. But nothing happened today, no events, no competitions, and so that spark died out. The energy these two bring is something that they need more of if they want to make the show a success",

Literally nothing for the fish to do.\n\nIt got boring so a staffer dropped off six Pickleball sets. The fish had no idea what to do with it and after 10 minutes gave up.\n\nTTS is now delayed until \"after midnight\", and Jet is desperately using exclusive TTS from staff to try and make anything funny happen (which isn't working).\n\ntotal boring mess",

The contestants themselves and their interactions which is the fun part are just failing to provide excitement. The most interactive guy so far is Jon the actual lisping autist. Not to mention the host is failing to do anything interesting or set up cool events, and the whole concept of the \"edgy hell house\" which the whole show was set up on is gone, you can't even do TTS.

Those people deserve to be hassled and it's funny to see them anguish.\nBut if you're genuinely upset that you can't just say naughty words and call people ugly on this stream that obviously has an entirely different comedic and entertainment purpose you should fuck off.",
