TTS about him being censored was just evening the playing field. Even now TTS is allowed to call him retarded and autistic but you still can't call Sylvia fat or Letty a whore.\n>b-b-but he gets special privileges\nEveryone goes downstairs when stressed, everyone makes requests from Jet and has them fulfilled.\n>b-b-but he gets away with not participating in challenges\nSo he never wins any fisbucks. In fact he's treated the worst because both challenges that he won didn't even count (the skit challenge elimination immunity was ignored, he didn't receive anything for winning Hyde and Seek II). He even had both hands taped in the cooking challenge when everyone else only had one hand taped. They fucked him over on the hot dog challenge knowing he was reluctant to eat pork. They fucked him over in The Cage by pulling him out for something they even admitted didn't matter.\n>b-b-but they show him favoritism\nHe was kicked in the face, humiliated by being told to wear a helmet all the time, repeatedly singled out by sharks until he literally began intimidating them, they even tried to force Jetty by putting him in a room with Letty alone twice.\nJon has been through the wringer, if any other fish had to deal with this they'd have fucked off long ago.\n\nIf anything Josie is the most privileged. The producers literally NEVER fuck with her and constantly play into her le quirky girl stuff.",

If he doesn't know what that trope is and hasn't seen people behaving like that then how is he supposed to know how to act \"schizophrenic\"?\n\nIt was just stupid to give him that disability in the first place.

It's obvious unless you're autistic or have never spoken to a woman before. It's the nicey nicey act to get something she wants, like whenever she does the high-pitched little-girl voice around Vance or Jon, then goes into one of the bedrooms and talks to chat like a cringy teenager. If you've met a girl like this IRL you'd know, but you never leave your Mom's basement",
