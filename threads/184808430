The constant spam calling people pedos and shit seems more like an organized effort than a natural escalation of shitpost wars. Seems more like people who just hate the show now than actual Letty fans though. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the discord the Marky spammer trannies came from, notice how they're gone now? They've just switched up their tactics to calling fans of the show pedophiles instead of Sam himself. I thought Lettybugs just became more unhinged recently but now I think it's more likely just the mindbroken trannies obsessed with Sam \n\n>>184808249\nThinking you might be right desu, apologies to the lettybugs if true",

In her current state her flaws severely outweigh her good features but weight loss would boost her immensely.\n\nJosie is average looking, maybe slightly below. She has large eyes and mostly average features, but a very long midface. She\u2019s tall though so it\u2019s less off putting than on someone short. Her hair is long and healthy, and she\u2019s skinny but not sickly. Combined with her interests and politeness I can see why so many men and women latched onto her.\n\nLetty is genuinely ugly. Her face is completely flat, she has a severely wide square jaw, tiny too far apart eyes, a butt chin, and a horrific hairline. The lens distortion from her glasses don\u2019t help either- it\u2019s higher than in her older photos and she doesn\u2019t wear eye makeup to offset it anymore. Her hair looks damaged as fuck (probably from malnutrition from starving herself) and doesn\u2019t suit her. Her body was nice when she weighed more but her face was still fuck ugly. I honestly think if she weren\u2019t so ugly people wouldn\u2019t hate her as much and she\u2019d have better self esteem, and wouldn\u2019t have gotten with her insane mentally ill ex. Anyways, she\u2019s ugly. Only other uggos or people with severe mental issues would find her face attractive. Nobody wants to look at a woman who looks like she got bashed in the face with a frying pan 50 times. I feel bad for her- she\u2019s scrutinized harder than the other contestants only because she\u2019s an ugly woman. If she wins she should get plastic surgery.",

Josie is genuinely ugly. She's flat. She has an ugly face with thick mannish lips, a misshapen head, and piercings all over. She is flat, wears extremely baggy clothes to hide her ugly figure, has no ass or feminine qualities at all. She is legitimately, objectively speaking, like a 3/10. Her only redeeming quality about her physical appearance is that she's thin and that gives her 2 points.\n\nLetty has a very ugly butterface but her body is actually like an 8/10. She has large breasts for her size and she's very lithe. Shame about her lazy eye, nappy hair, and complete uggo bombed out face.\n\nNone of the women on this show are above a 5/10 and the fact that both Josie and Letty have an absolute army of simps shows that you faggots would lust over literal boys as long as they're thin. That's how mindbroken and starved for affection you are.",

There's a reason she's wearing extremely baggy clothes and doesn't try to dress feminine. She's aware of how ugly she is.\n\nThe best she can pull off is hiding it all under baggy clothes because that's what ugly women do. Why do you think that outside of this show filled with NEET loser audience that Josie has been called ugly her entire life and her behavior SCREAMS \"recluse ugly weirdo loser who was picked on her entire life\"? For the love of god, read between the lines and get your eyes fixed.\n\nI wish Fish Tank would just for 1 second bring an actual 9/10 into the house so the simp spell would get broken.",

I'm angry that enough pathetic retarded faggots exist that even these extremely ugly women have a loyal army of orbiter followers and their standards are so low that they think these objectively ugly women are attractive.\n\nBut in a way, it explains a lot of pathetic simp behavior and how quickly men will lower their standards to adapt to what is available. Fish tank has only ugly women, so the simps flock equally between all of the ugly options(except the fat girl because modern men hate fat women). Women would never do this. If the show didn't have attractive men, they wouldn't watch. They wouldn't adjust their standards. Women are just better than men like that in not compromising what they want.",

So they think \"she's just like me but with a vagina!!!\" and that she's attainable or something.\n\nIt's not that she's broadly likeable. It's that she has a very specific appeal to NEET losers that like childlike, quiet, passive women who don't seem too difficult.",

She has absolutely no skills at all and I've yet to see her succeed at anything she has attempted. If you told me she lives with and sponges off of her parents or a boyfriend, I wouldn't doubt you.\n\nSylvia: She has an onlyfans, do I need to say more? She comes off as lazy and has a bad attitude and probably thinks she is some kind of superstar because she is top 10% on onlyfans or something (which means she earns more than $4.99 a month). I honestly don't have a single positive thing to say about her.\n\nVance: He's boring to watch and seems to have much in the way of an identity, but he looks like an average joe. He's probably tried (and failed) at a bunch of stuff and is looking for some way of breaking out of his mundane existence.\n\nChris: Can't stand the guy. I hate fatties, it is just a sign of a disgusting person if you ask me. Both inside and outside. He acts like an obnoxious know it all half the time, and the other half he's bordering on mental breakdown because of some internet spat that has gone on way too long or something.
