And was saying how she'd never do that and how bad she thinks that is. And you can see Sulvia in the room too. Quite. And Letty must have realised too. Because then Letty said something like 'Not that there's any thing wrong with sex workers or porn performers. I have nothing against them... Just the industry'. But I don't think Letty actually believes that. I think Princess Letty is disgusted by sex workers.",
