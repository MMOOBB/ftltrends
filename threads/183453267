Normally you'd merge all streams into one video on the start page and place links onto each square. So each user watching it only is streaming the videos once. But the way it is set up each time you go to that main page you're streaming the amount of 10 users due to all streams going individually.\nSo 6k viewers suddenly cost as much as 60k viewers in streaming costs. Without the revenue 60k would bring.\n\nThis also matches with their initial claims od 60k users. Their devs are literally inexperienced kids. That or offshore pajeets kek",

I also only use /tv/, I can't imagine myself going to any other board anymore. /tv/ kinda has it all. I disagree that this belongs here, DVD set or not. While I can see where you're coming from if your argument is that something doesn't have to air on TV to be considered TV, I don't think this counts because it's more of an experimental livestream than a structured reality show. Yes, there absolutely should be a different board for this and similar things. People have been asking for that for years anyway, and it would make me happy not to have to see any fucking fishtank threads. Also, fuck you nigger don't tell me what to do.",
