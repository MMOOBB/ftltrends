When it drifts do you all of a sudden have a change in FOV and you have blind spot in the middle, or they generally unaware of it because their brain just helps fill in the blanks. I think it's funnier knowing that Letty knows her eyes were drifiting and know Sam reacted to it.\n\nAlso; does anyone have the clip of Chris going to Letty and saying Sylvia told him about the ex-bf situation?",

He was too high all the time to get into shape or make any real videos or do any collaborations. There's a lot of sad circumstances to his story but he also has himself to blame for a lot of where he finds himself today. Hoping the show reinvigorates him and gets him back on the right track.

Jet didn't realize Dameel would lose the plot and throw Letty shit in the porta potty. Anyone can tell he's escalating things since he beamed a ball towards lettys head and smash Lettys fake phone. The porta potty thing was the last straw for many, compound it with Lettys/Nina background bringing up an ex-bf which I'm not sure if there's legal repercussion be he's going to jail. Jet had to mediate because it is a fuck up that he has to amend hence why they're playing nice with letty for now.\n\nBummybustr because he has faggy photos, claims it's ironic(its not, natural evolution of a flip to go from fag to faux banger), involved in a hit and run(laying a hand on letty would fuck up his shit), mommy doesn't love him, dogshit relations with his dad. Also has a Gen z mumble rap \"career\" where he just talks with beats being played. Of course Incel fans that shuts the fuck up when someone starts spamming his Bummybustr picks.",

His heart was beating like a drum as he worked up the courage to speak: \u201cJosie, I have to tell you this. Josie- I\u2026 I love you. I\u2019ve loved you since I first set eyes on you. You\u2019re all think about, all I dream about. I watch you everyday from the basement cameras and my heart aches. Let me take you away from all of this. This house, this show.
