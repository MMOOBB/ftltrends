I want to prime Josie's surely beautiful red pussy by getting it sopping wet and dripping before I fill Josie with my SPRUCE with all 31 of her individually named plushies watching, give her a proper SPRUCING and force wrist-claps and all manner of autistic sex noises out of her, occasionally bearhugging her legs and motorboating her bare soles, or lovingly, sloppily giving her open mouthed tongue kisses, and sucking on her tongue. Naturally all of this is something we will do AFTER marriage (we will get married immediately).",

She would also have a perforated ballgag and a second reservoir attached to her bosom to collect her drool. I would keep a recording device active for the full duration to take a complete record of every gagged gasp and moan. After she has ridden waves of pleasure milking her for all she's worth over that 24 hour period I would collect her fluids and combine them then pour this delectable Josie-wine into the finest crystal for sampling, using the most professional sommelier technique I learned in preparation for this moment (by taking weekend sommelier classes at my community center). I would transcribe the audio recordings to vinyl and play that vinyl on the finest record player with the finest sound system money can buy, and light candles to accompany my curated samplings of the height of this girl's moans to set the mood. I'd twirl the glass in my hands and savor the wafting aroma of Josie's sex-essence before bringing it to my lips and tasting, letting the fine, viscous Navajo vintage wash over and coat every tastebud. After I had thoroughly appreciated the texture and all the subtleties of the tangy-salty-sweet flavor notes I'd briefly gargle and then swallow it, making Josie's intimately created love-wine a part of me forever.",
