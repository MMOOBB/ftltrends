This is insane\nYou can't help but respect the amount of power letty weilds over the tank and how easily she can manipulate people. It's literally second nature to her.\nFor ella, this is probably the biggest thing she will ever do in her life.. for letty, it's a tuesday.\nAt this point, i want her to win just based off the sheer negative feminine energy she brings, but all I really want is for sylvia to leave before her.

Even if he finds out it was all a lie made up by Sam, this moment has probably changed him forever and he'll probably redo his routine to be completely PC to avoid getting into hot water like other comedians as of late. He had potential with the kinda roast-centric humor, but his other jokes were very forgettable and I can't imagine going for sanitized comedy will help his career in any way.",

Does not having the most fishbucks at halftime count as a loss? Is that what you're saying? Because if you're saying that I can assure you that you're wrong. Why would you make this post when the game is still on? Letty is still playing right now and she has been the best fish in the tank for how many days now? She\u2019s playing one of the worst YouTubers on the internet who just happen to have a lead because he\u2019s feeding off the energy of nicks skuffed realtor streams. But you know what? Sam still fucking sucks. Letty is one of the best fucking girls in the all of Kingston, she ruined Jeremy and would have ruined Tommy too if Hillsborough County Police would\u2019ve done their fucking job. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded posts like this. You know why? Because you're going to be embarrassed when Letty wins and someone (you)\u2019s your post. Oh look at that, Ella is about to leave, just like the Daniel did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a post in /ftl/ again and I'm fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you're the only guy making all these anti-Letty posts because you're a faggot tranny who doesn't like her because she has a nice bushy innie pussy. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking fish on the board, like I give a fuck. It's so easy to spot out your posts now, you're a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don't you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a post like this.

She saw there was no way to build a table, atleast not for her, so she did the next best thing- provide content. I've said it before, she's so good at baiting and reversebaiting people that it's become indistinguishable from retardation. She's probably gotten thousands of (You)s on this site by pretending to be stupid. But again, when it comes to people, she's ridiculously intuitive and knows exactly how to play them. She's probably the smartest person in the tank, and probably smarter than the producers. It's just a shame she's using that brain to be a fucking harpy that steals the souls of men for sustenance.\nI unironically want her to win",

Once she realized that, she leaned into the hate and started manipulating them into hating her because she knows it's better to cause seethe even if they hate you because then you're still the center of attention. Sylvia was basically buckbroken by letty before letty even started talking shit to her, looking at the timeline. Also something intresting is that she genuinely didnt shittalk sylvia's appearance at all until AFTER she was told that sylvia was talking about her ex boyfriend (not sure if chris was lying about this). She only talked about her personality, so it seems like she either has some kind of boundries or simply knows how awful it looks to make fun of someone's appearance. Also keep in mind that basically everyone else in the tank and tts have been making fun of her appearance for weeks",

The challenge was unique in that it was solely for Letty and there was no actual prize involved. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see Letty build a table. She was the obvious choice considering her total incompetence at any practical mundane task. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, Letty has been pretty diligent in trying her best to win each challenge and taking them seriously, yet with this challenge she seemed to sandbag the thing throughout the entire day. She left the wood exactly where Jet dropped it for hours while she asked for legendary tools like wood salt and heat nails. When they finally forced her to work on it, she just sat there trying to saw a 2x4 with a fucking steak knife and olive oil. Now, whether or not Letty knew from the get-go that people were fucking with her, it's obvious that she was privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that Letty perceived that the entire challenge was just so that everybody could laugh at her trying to build a table, which she obviously cannot do, so she won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that she could do, not even try, thus denying big-brains the pleasure of watching her fail while simultaneously fooling the small brains into thinking that she actually WAS trying and failing. This shit even had Vance and Sam wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Letty is THE only truly interesting character on this piece of shit show. Ella has been watching everything, talked with Letty in person for a while, and already admitted that she can't gauge her and thinks that she is being both serious and not serious at the same time. She truly is the queen of the realm.",

Let them develop their own conclusions through experiences you carefully let them digest until they reach the same conclusions you have on their own with your mentorship.

She has a bunch of insane exes because she likely drove them all insane. She's not really into cool shit. She is into a bunch of semi-edgy stuff that gets her attention from extremely online simps (like saying Ted Kaczynski was right). When she talks about stuff she actually likes its all extreme normie shit like Mitski. She's fake as fuck, mega two-faced and has an over inflated narcissistic ego. She definitely cleans up well when she's wearing makeup and not being viewed through a 240p fish eye lens but she is not hot enough to match her level of insane.\n\nElla is a lesbian tiktok zoomer, she has no real personality and I don't care about her. She got into MDE through the Idubbbz documentary that came out last year. She sucks ass. She's basically on Vance's level of just being a nontent piece of wallpaper I don't care about.\n\nJosie is a queen. She's into the perfect amount of weird internet shit where you could talk with her about Chris-Chan or Tamers12345 without getting the fluoride stare. But she's not so fucked up and online that it becomes repulsive and causes brain rot. She's a tomboy at heart but also likes some feminine stuff like plushies and DDR. She loves white guys. She has the best personal style of everyone on the show. She knows how to hide her power level (week one was asked if she watched anime and said no despite drawing guro art). She's cute and innocent and weird and wonderful and I want to protect her.\n\nThanks for reading my blog.",
