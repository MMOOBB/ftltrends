Every day I would wake you up by cumming in you and every night I would cum in you right before going to sleep, which I would do with my dick stuck inside you. I would take some viagra before bed just to maintain my erection so that you'll be ready in the morning when I thrust into you like an animal and slather you in kisses. Part of our wedding vows would be to have as many children as physically possible. I wouldn't even care if you are already pregnant, I'll fuck you while you're pregnant and you'll get double pregnant. I'll fill you with so much cum every day that you'll look pregnant even when you aren't (which you'll never be after we're married) I would do everything in my power to make you as fertile as possible. I'd give you fertility drugs, I'd give you uterus massages, breast massages, I wouldn't let you go 5 hours without at least one spastic orgasm. I'll even bake you home made lactation inducing biscuits to help you get to a point of hyperlactation syndrome so that you'll be seeping out multiple quarts of milk per day. Which I will save and drink just so that I can tell you how delicious it is. I'll make you so fertile that triplets will be the minimum number you'll be carrying at any given time. I would literally never stop doting on you, I would respond to you every beck and call and I would cum inside you again each time you ask for something. You would be so pregnant all the time that you would literally not be able to stand up straight. Your spine would be permanently bent out of shape to accommodate a pregnant belly. Even after you can't get pregnant anymore I would just keep putting more eggs into you. I would clone you purely so that I can put fresh eggs from the clone inside you after you run out of them. You would have so much progesterone running through your veins at any given time that even the thought of not being pregnant would seem alien to you.",

Maybe he'll be back, and as a spectator, for the sheer entertainment value and chaos it would cause I hope he does because he was the only one making this show watchable for me at this point and I don't care to indulge in this garbage anymore. What this dude really needs is a lot of mental help, exercise, and proper life guidance. He was a huge liability and being on this show does him no favors. I sincerely hope he gets his shit in order even if he probably won't. I'm expecting a suicide or heart attack within a few years. \n\n>>185093966\nIt pissed me off too even if in many ways Chris had it coming. I don't like the two-faced giggly schoolyard bullying they were doing because it's just pussy behavior, especially seeing the dude was trying to make amends and was gonna be leaving. If they have a problem with the guy, it's better to speak their mind about it rather than act like children making faces at him like a bunch of faggots. Like yeah okay he's cringe, we get it, you got anything interesting or profound to say though? Some wisdom or parting advice? I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a bunch of autistic zoomers on an internet reality show. These faggots are all pretty much insufferable to me since they're not only unlikable now but they're boring too. I mean what are my options here? Hmmm. The balding NPC beta cuck? The BPD scat-obsessed neet with googly eyes? Some boring shitskin sperg who wants to mutilate herself? Why should I respect these people? Can't I just have Jon the wholesome retard back? \n\nHope you guys enjoyed Jet's parasocial playhouse! that'll be $40.",

You need to understand that every fish in the tank is part of a the challenge. They don't have the option to be part of it or to not be part of it. Jon, by doing nothing, lost the challenge and got kicked.",

Part of him doing fuck all during the challenge was him training with Sam and the MMA guy they bring in sometimes when he was supposed to be on crutches. He went to the basement to get them to stop the retard lightning round and he was gone later that day after they did nothing but wait for Goldstriker to show up. He quit but they put on the show so he could keep his fishbucks and some pride.",
