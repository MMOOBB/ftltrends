If they fail, have loudspeakers play intermittant pig noises throughout the night while they sleep.",

I would advise against trying to find a gf via discord or any niche forum but that's just me and I am pretty normal and just use a dating app or once in a blue moon I will have a girl approach me. I never talk to them first though, was burned too many times and said fuck it\n\n\nbtw dating a josie girl long distance is like smacking an atom bomb with a sledgehammer over and over.

He has actual autism to a lesser extent where he doesn't need to be in an institution but severe enough that it binds him from ever being independent and comprehending. He's not quick to catch on and he even admitted that he was taken advantage of and scammed numerous times. His declaration that he's 'done trusting people' is pitifully contradicted by his goal to pay for Tate's Hustlers University groupchat. His caretakers clearly thought he was functional enough to attempt to live a normal life where he was put into social situations with people only to be ostracized from the group and mocked, himself not fully understanding why. He sort of understands something is wrong with him like when he thought the reason Simmons wouldn't let him roleplay as Tate was because he 'had autism'. You can tell his entire life he was searching for someone to look up to and he latches on to anyone who gives confident advice like when he believed Sam's 'exercise routine' of doing 100 chair jumps per day was actually a secret to some Hawaiian Martial Art. His actions (sleeping on the floor despite having a bed) leave people wondering what his rationale is. Is he trying to seem tough, is he trying to emulate a role model, is he flagellating himself over his actions? Or maybe he just likes floors.\nThere are millions of people out there like Jon who exist only to be fed lies and fall victim to scams while trying to free themselves from their mental shackles, unaware that the cuffs have no key and searching for one just makes them feel tighter. He is doomed to wander, searching for an answer as to why people dislike him and why he is treated 'unfairly'. When people don't want to interact with him he immediately assumes he must've slighted them in some way or that there must've been an incident that caused it. When he's told to shut up he think it's because of the things he's saying not that he's saying.",
