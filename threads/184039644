Had they let him stay the very same markyspammers (not saying all Simmons defenders are markyspammers but they latched on to this) would have been spamming about how Sam let a pedophile stay on the show. You can think Sam was too mean about it or whatever, and I will agree that it did have a negative impact on the dynamics of the house that I don't think the crew had anticipated, but I can't bring myself to feel sorry for him. I don't buy that what Sam did qualifies as defamation, there was enough there to reasonably believe him to be a pedophile.",

Meanwhile, they've been gaslighting everyone else into thinking that Nick is a spoiled rich kick whose dad's money is paying for the show, and that Vance's behaviour jeopardised that. In the middle of Vance's schizo bit they brought Nick back in and had him tell Vance that he wasn't putting in enough effort, that he was ruining the show and that he was really disappointed in him. Vance bought it and was on the verge of tears. He was then forced to turn up his shitty schizo acting to 11 and to lean into the \"I can't believe I'm ruining the show\" thing, all the while actually being legitimately concerned that he was ruining the show.",

For me, I keep seeing the book quotes and the instagram post and it just makes me wonder who genuinely believes that this marks someone as a threat to children, given all the info we have.\nI bet if you showed the book and the instagram post to someone unbiased with no leading question and no red circles they would never come to the pedo conclusion. It's only when you're acting in extremely bad faith and really want to give the worst possible interpretation to antagonize someone. Especially in this zoomer online hate/rage bait sphere that is twitter and 4chan where drama and exaggeration are their drugs.\nThe only reason I actually care about this particular instance of online drama is because I see Simmons as a severly disadvantaged underdog. No influence, no supporters,lacking communication and social skills, no money. And he's up against influential, charismatic, wealthy people that have a mob at their disposal that listens to their command. And the stakes for him are pretty high since pedo allegations can ruin a life forever but the stakes for his opponents are low because they'll never face the consequences for what they're doing for shits n giggles. \n\nRarely do I see such an imbalance of power with all the odds stacked against the underdog who - from my understanding - is innocent unfolding in real time.",

For me it's more the way he acted that makes me suspect he might be one but it's not definitive proof and he doesn't deserve to have his life ruined over it.

Jet is the director of the project & he assumed a lot of risk by making this show. but even though its Jet's project it's being funded by Sam. if Sam wanted to fire Jet & take over Fishtank he could. after all the technical and financial hurdles during week 1, I imagine Sam might have been getting nervous and impatient with Jet. and it felt like his stress got the better of him when he pulled that stunt with Simmons\n\nidk if any of you recall this but Jet looked pretty caught off guard by it. i got the sense that Sam came in like a wrecking ball without consulting him fully on what would happen. it didn't feel like something Jet would sign off on. and when he was done he handed the mess right back to Jet\n\nobviously i can't confirm any of this but it lines up well with the way the show has fallen apart since. i believe Jet had a different idea of where the show would be by now. i can't shake the feeling that the fallout from the Simmons thing traumatized Jet too. Jet has to take responsibility for whatever happens on Fishtank. its successes & failures rest on his shoulders. idk i feel like Sam violated that",

Sam saying you can't trust letty is the same as making Jon say \"yes, sensei.\" He is cutting at their personalities. \n\nJon can't be an obvious retard and not catch bullshit about it, just like how Letty can't be an obvious seductress and not catch shit about it. Some people just get really upset about the latter. \n\nIt can never be this simple for some people (bpds), but this has wider consequences for gender relations. Should women be able to act however they want without being held accountable, called out, like any other human being would? If there was a man using the tone of voice Letty uses sometimes, I would be equally on guard, because it's genuinely creepy. \n\nI had a thing with a bpd girl once and I know the highs and lows of that. That same disassociative, deviant behavior was what I experienced with her, followed by extreme distrust. Again, very disassociative. These people are dangerous. There's no other way to put it. Just like how Jon is stupid, she is dangerous. It's part of who she is, and she should be grilled on it like everyone else. Jon absolutely loses points for being a pussy about tts, and letty should for being a creep. Simple as.",

This whole thing better be in greater service to the final product, which should be a documentary of Jet and all the shit he had to go through to keep this going. It would actually be really cool to see most of it behind the scenes and the toll it is having in him but i doubt they have the soul to produce something like that",

I would have thought Jet himself has put at least some of his own money into it.\n>idk if any of you recall this but Jet looked pretty caught off guard by it. i got the sense that Sam came in like a wrecking ball without consulting him fully on what would happen. it didn't feel like something Jet would sign off on. and when he was done he handed the mess right back to Jet\nSam announced what he was going to do pretty much on Twitter. I think what they didn't expect was for it to cause so much reaction amongst the contestants.\n> i believe Jet had a different idea of where the show would be by now. i can't shake the feeling that the fallout from the Simmons thing traumatized Jet too. Jet has to take responsibility for whatever happens on Fishtank. its successes & failures rest on his shoulders. idk i feel like Sam violated that\nThe show is probably doing financially fine, and the Simmons thing, although potentially a major legal fuckup, hasn't really caused any audience backlash. Even here, where most people thought the Simmons thing went too far, it's still easily the most active board on /tv/. I would imagine when they get round to the Simmons issue in their final cut, they'll add some legalese disclaimer of 'Simmons denies the allegations levied against him, and says the quotes were taken out of context' blah blah and nobody will really care.",
