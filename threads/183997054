But his absolute mogging of her was so unprecedented that she's seeing him as an obstacle to overcome, her epic challenge, her magnum HPD opus. Plus, she is the type of leftist woman who acts out so she can have a completely antithetical masculine figure dominate her. Last night's nagging was very telling, she was acting like a school girl with a crush. 2 more weeks and he'll be occupying all the real estate in her head and will turn into Jeremy with her obsession over him.\nFishtank has been a fantastic character study of genuine human interactions between antisocial people, you cannot script this.",

Viewership increased steadily day after day up until the Simmons incident. \nSince then, each day has been lower than the last. Yesterday is the first time Sam hasn't shown up and there was no real challenge of any kind.\nSo what went wrong, unironically? I'm going to list a few things:\n>Inconsistency on rules for contestants and audience involvement. At first the production issues were novel, put now that things are smoothed out it feel like they are simply moving the show in whatever direction brings in the most simp bucks\n>Kicking out Simmons in such a dramatic fashion, causing Maruo to walk out the same day. Say what you want about Simmons, but I think everyone can mostly agree the situation should have been handled differently and the fallout has been detrimental to the show\n>Challenges and eliminations largely being done away with and seemingly not being enforced or upheld in any way. You need some constants on the show.\n>The way the sharks interact with the fish. At this point I think everyone can agree the fish have been spoiled to a certain degree, completely altering the dynamic of the show (for the worst)\n>24/7 TTS, while a money-maker, is better used an hour or two a day to fuck with the vibe of the house and get the Fish talking\nThere's a lot more I can list, but I think anyone who has tuned in from day one will agree this thing is simply turning in whatever will keep the simp bucks flowing. It's like an odd version of a hottub stream at this point. Which is a shame, because peak viewership was happening when the show was much closer to how it was originally intended...",

Also would make competing for snacks and loot crates an actual thing. And trading the goodies with other fishies. So a bit like prison",
