And also if (You) were in chips spot? and like what if she got drunk enough to say it to (You)r face that she wants to be bred by a big white guy? and like what if (You) took her to B4 and mating pressed her frail red frame? Wouldn't that be hilarious? and like what if she was moaning and yelping, never having experienced this sort of pleasure before? That would be so fucking funny dude. What if (You) shot a huge thick rope of cum deep into her womb? I cannot think of anything funnier. I would be laughing so fucking hard if I was spraying my white seed all over her walls. I would be cackling, even! And just imagine how strong her unwashed and likely unshaven pussy smells? Imagine pulling down those baggy pants to reveal her pink panties, already able to get a pretty solid idea of what you're in store for, but then when you pull her panties down too you're immediately overwhelmed by the sheer HEAT being drawn out from under her undies? That would be so fucking funny lol Just imagine running your tongue through her lips, and realizing just how sour it tastes after not having showered for DAYS, and hearing her whimper when your tongue touches her sensitive, virgin clit. That would be so unbelievably funny. And what if like, she was jerking you off while you were tasting her unwashed cunt? Holy fuck I seriously can't think of anything funnier. I'm sure the smell of hard white cock would be super hilarious for her too!",
