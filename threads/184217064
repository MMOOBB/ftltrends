So DamieL heard that, internalized it, and had it rattling in his head for all this time until he was drunk enough to blurt it out. This guy has been actively thinking about how he doesn't have a chance with Josie.\nI was saying the DamieL x Josie friendship and/or relationshipping was retarded bullshit as early as before the Simmons incident, I get tired of being aware of shit before most of you.\nOh, and the only reason Vance and Sylvia are humoring DamieL's drunken ramblings is because they want him to think it's okay to quit to improve their chances. There's no sympathy at play here, it's a balding cobra and a fat python just trying to win.\nFuck chiggers btw.",

I said that all of this is a running theme of Sam and his production using his status to exploit and profit of the misery of people less fortunate than him, right in line with most reality TV, Simmons included. The fact you\u2019re caught up on individual personalities and situations and are unable to apply a level of thinking to anything beyond that shows you operate on a low frequency nigger-tier mode of thought, and the only reason you\u2019re arguing against any of this is because in this example it\u2019s a off-putting mentally ill girl that now has the entirety of Sams following and influence dragging her through the mud. \n\nYou lack objective reasoning skills and you\u2019re unable to reason.

None of the mental midgets in that house can bother with a lawsuit lol and none of them look the type to sue regardless.\n\nIn the case that they are, there are probably a billion waivers in the contract they signed which covers most bases. I'm not sure what you could even argue they could sue for. There is a producer/someone watching at all times in the basement which covers duty of care, and they've shown they intervene when stuff starts going off the rails. If they want to sue, there has to be an actual tort made out or law broken, not just 'scary vibes' with damiel around",

I think in the 70s and 80s it was really bad and the government got sick of endless america style tort lawsuits so they just neutered them. \n\nFor example making out negligence is an endless nightmare that almost never succeeds, all the payouts are capped insanely low (like under 500k or something), and you have to be minimum 20-30% \"disabled\" by whatevers occurred to get 10% of the payout lol",
