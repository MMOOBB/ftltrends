Yeah I know most beginner recommended guns are like Ruger 10/22's or other small caliber stuff, but I'm impatient and just wanna skip to the cooler stuff.

They hire literal retards. Like, people with down syndrome. \n\nIf you do get asked a lame interview question at a job interview, just give them a lame interview answer. Talk about how you have a \"strong work ethic\" and teamwork or whatever. Just make yourself do it. If you humiliate yourself in front of a Walmart hiring manager will your life really be much worse?
