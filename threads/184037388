She's fucked cheated on and made porn between a bunch of dudes, she has noticeable BPD, has no work experience, and doesn't have the looks to get away with it and pull a decent but dumb dude, all she has in store for her future is being a hole and getting passed around by a bunch of fuck ups, her BPD constantly burning bridges and ensuring she has no safety net besides her rich father, and she's going to age really badly with that face. If she hadn't been ruined by feminism and the internet she could have been a small town school teacher with a hard working husband and kids, instead she'll probably commit suicide or overdose on something in a decade. Very depressing outcome. I guess since she's a radical feminist she asked for this but I still can't help but feel bad about someone who doesn't know any better destroying themselves.

From the data one anon posted last night from the polls they've sold a minimum of 3000 which is a pretty good amount, especially once adding in the TTS and fishtoy revenue.",

Given that you need to spend money to vote in said poll it's pretty reasonable to assume almost all of those users were pass holders. That gives a baseline of around $130k in pass sales before taxes/fees. TTS is normally $50 but has been $25 for the past few days. When active (around half the day on average) there's about 3 messages or so every minute. If TTS messages are sold at the current rate for the rest of the show (kind of a big assumption they may slow down at some point) they'll end up making several million dollars for those. Fishtoys cost more, anywhere from $100-$500 ($800 if you don't have the pass holder discount but I doubt anyone buying those doesn't) but they aren't sold that frequently. That said the Josie plush fishtoy has made over $5000 on its own at this point. Hosting costs are hard to know for sure but $10k is completely plausible given how expensive video streaming is. Sam said they spent $300k so far but it's hard to know what that all entailed, likely the cost for the house, lawyer fees, equipment, and hosting up to that point. They've also committed to paying out at most $130k to the contestants at this point if all fishbucks are rewarded and redeemed. Most of this is just guesswork and I could be completely wrong but they may end up profiting a million dollars or more from this. It really isn't as big a failure as some anons would like to believe.",
