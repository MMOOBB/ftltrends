I've seen plenty of zoomers start and almost immediately fail some online career.\n\nI remember this one girl I followed because she was smoking hot and I just wanted to fap to her if I'm being honest. In the period of about a year she tried to be (and failed) an influencer of some sort. Then she tried to stream and failed. Then she went and made an onlyfans account and after releasing tame porn she quit that and then she tried to be a vtuber but didn't even get started with it.\n\nI got no idea what she is doing now but I can guarantee it's nothing successful.",
