The whole point of this is to wear these fuckers down until they snap and leave (yes I know there's elimination challenges), so hopefully the crew can chill out and let these guys go crazy without Jon the baby. Simmons was eliminated too early and it would have been absolute gold if Sam just came in and read the books like he did, but then just left it at that so the fish could draw their own conclusions. Then let chaos ensue. As far as I'm aware, Simmons doesn't have a record and is just sus so no legal liability issues as far as that goes. I think Sam freaked because his lawyer said one of the most important things was \"no sex offenders\" and he jumped the gun. with Jon and Simmons gone there isn't anyone left for the others to hate as deeply. It's just gonna be \"Letty Snakes People: The Show\" now.",

If they don't in the next day or 2, which we know will sadly be the case, I'll be willing to say its dead. Doomposters were right though regardless of what happens and I don't blame anyone for giving up on this shitfest.",

I almos lost my job neetmaxing this shit, the real fishtank experience is watching and being in these threads. One must become not a fish in the tank, but the tank itself, a tank-becoming by way of the cammeras, a becoming and never a reaching, for one also speaks with them with TTS. A breaking of the boundaries of where you really are. Am I in my house? or am I just a camera?, watching, observing, waiting. A becoming-tank tied to a becoming-poster, by losing yourself in the mass of posts on the threads. You wasted your 40 bucks by not watching, you nigger.",
