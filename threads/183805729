You can buy it on Amazon right now over the counter, no prescription needed.\nIt's 100% natural and only gives your body the building blocks it needs to level out your hormones/mood. Depression isn't something we can always just snap out of. It can be a chemical imbalance and I've seen first hand how it dramatically can change someone.\nTook about a week and a half to build up in her system but she is night and day. She used to\n>cry everyday\n>moody\n>irrationally angry over minor things\nMight as well try it. She's completely better. There's no bad effects if you stop taking it cold turkey too. You'd just return to your base line. She also takes Ashwaganda so you can give that a shot too if you'd like, but from what I understand, the SAM-E is what has really helped.\nAlso of course take zinc, lots of vitamin D, vitamin k2, and pray to Jesus.",

You should be pretty much torturing yourself with constant lifts, impulsive bodyweight exercises, running in place, jumping jacks, etc. Devote all of your time to getting stronger.

There will be random guests and challenges throughout the days and weeks and especially prizes, you control the action and every action causes a reaction to the house. 6 weeks of doing nothing? No way, these people are on their toes and have to get prepared for every challenge we give them. Thank you Letty for your creative house destruction by shaking your baby, i now have an excuse to eliminate Simmons instead of using cancel culture to evict him and scare Mauro out of the house. Also i won' snitch that you did it.\n\nLets go Goldfishes!",

Its because normies see a guy like Mauro and internally think \"this fat loser is obviously the person that everyone makes fun of, well I'm better then that! I can see past the layers of fat to his genuine soul and can see him for the nice person he is!\" so they act overly nice too him. If he had stayed on the house the first time he screwed up it would have all come out and twitter would have been like \"fuck this fat idiot\" Ive seen it before. anyone feel the same way? I'm not saying hes a bad guy but i don't see a logical reason for so much praise, if i had to describe him i would say hes boring and the same generic fake friendly you get with any effeminate fat guy.",

You can't find happiness in just mourning your existence. Because that's all your going to be identifying with. Thats all anyone is gonna SEE. If you have literally anything else to go on with, hobbywise, that you can expand, you can at least inch forward in a material way to progressing SOMETHING. You won't bother to progress from the inward out because you're clearly to focused on the 'out'. All you are doing right now is building a shitty personality that is exactly how it appears, fucking ugly.\nBut you're not, you're just a desert brained dustbowl that's handicapped from any nice human connections, and aren't willing to improve, and are too smart to really listen to anyone else. You're capable of plenty just on the merit of being able to bitch and moan here, you're not a fish fin with an eye being kept alive by a 9 volt battery, you're just a guy.",
