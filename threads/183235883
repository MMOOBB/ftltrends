This suggests sex isn't even evolutionarily designed to be particularly pleasurable for women.\n\nOnly about 20% of women reach orgasm by penetration alone.\n\nWomen pay for sex exceptionally rarely. E.g., from a Swiss survey: 30% of men, but NOT ONE out of 1,000 surveyed women (0%!) have paid for sex.\n\nFake scam dating ads almost exclusively target straight men: strong evidence of higher male libido.\n\nThere are now roughly 70 MILLION excess men in China and India who will live and die without partners, according to surveys.\n\nTinder usage is correlated with lower self-esteem for men but not women.\n\nAverage women receive 15 times as many matches as average men on Tinder.\n\nMost online dating sites are dominated by men: only 21% of Tinder users are female (Statista 2019).\n\nWomen are statistically more attracted to men who are already in relationships than single men.\n\nWomen's average reported sex partner counts DOUBLE when they're connected to a polygraph (lie detector).\n\nIn a survey of normal women currently in a relationship, half (50%!) reported having a \"backup\" lover in their social circle.\n\nMen are 8x more likely than women to regret passing up casual sex (28.9% M, 3.6% F); i.e., women have higher action regret, while men have higher inaction regret.\n\nAccording to a trial by Fisher (2012), published in the Journal of Sex Research, men think about sex on average 34 times a day, while women thought about sex 19 times a day, i.e. men on average think 1.8 times as often about sex.\n\nMen reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and when asked to estimate the actual frequency of their experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week).",

                "comment": ">>183236528\nNot only is women's sex drive lower, but women are also unavailable for sex 10-15% of the time due to menstruation. If you try to initiate sex during menstruation, only 20% of women reported willingness to have sex in that period. Moreover, all men aged 20 to 60 mainly desire youth and good looks, while the relative proportion of old men is growing due to falling birth rates (which means an aging overall population) and a slightly higher birth rate of males. Hence, lots of men compete for few fertile, sexually available and young women.\n\nWomen rapidly lose interest in sex once in a stable relationship or living with a man. Conversely, male sexual desire was found to remain constant, or even increased throughout the course of the relationship.\n\nThe more men love their wife, the more they want to have sex with their wife. The more women loved their husbands, the LESS they wanted to have sex with those husbands.\nMen showed affection by initiating sex, sharing leisure activities, and doing housework with their wives. By contrast, women showed affection by reducing negative or antagonistic behaviors (e.g, nagging less and being less annoying).",

If they would have gotten borderline homeless people and the price money was like 50k instead of 10k maybe then they could get away with no filter cheap TTS but these people are not ready for the heat TTS is going to bring (imo).\n \nTo be honest i wouldn't be surprised if the tranny leaves early even with the filtered and expensive TTS because when he finds out people know hes a dude and start talking about all the shit they dug up he might get super triggered/scared and just leave.",

That's actually one of the keys to torture and brainwashing - a never ending stream of meticulous, largely meaningless routine. From the moment you wake up, you are herded from activity to activity, such that you never have a moment to think. It would definitely border on actual torture, of course. And it wouldn't really create conflict unless you literally recreated the Stanford prison experiment.\n\nI know next to nothing about Big Brother, but I believe that works because they get to live in relative opulence with the ever present meta-game of voting people out lingering in the background. It's like a microcosm of the politicking of a royal court.\n\nIf you wanted to go with making life Hell, you do that for a week max. At least a long weekend. In that case you could make it 24/7 retardation because people will only be able to put up with it for so long.\n\nBut this is actually the worst option - extremely long time frame, no reason for conflict, no interaction, intentionally making them bored.

Sam came in with the idea of edgy fun, dumped it out, and now has nothing except for Jet blurting out whatever comes to mind",

Jon fucked it up and now you want to protect him instead of rightfully punishing him for being a big mouthed fucking idiot MDE fan who just wanted to meet Sam as opposed to a genuine cast member who wanted to be in the next hottest reality TV show.
