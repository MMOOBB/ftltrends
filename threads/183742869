Sam confronting him live with random out of context shit from his past that he clearly just saw on twitter without investigating further, and making a huge performance out of Simmons being kicked out to turn into \"content\" is one of the most retarded things I've ever seen, it fucked up all the other contestants, made Mauro leave, mindbroke Jon, split the audience on whether it was justified, made it so the cameras had to be shut off so the contestants could cope, and completely fucked up the vibe. He should've been quietly removed off camera and the fish should've been informed off camera too. I was indifferent to all the other \"disasters\" of the show so far but this was actually a huge fuck up. In terms of whether Simmons is guilty or not, I don't know and I don't really care. He just seems like a clueless chinaman to me who doesn't understand the culture he lives in at all. Either way he had to go and the way they got rid of him was fucking awful \n\nHopefully the vibes are back to normal tomorrow",

Everything he does leads to him pushing away everyone who calls themselves his friend. Now WP got jewed that is true but the way he did it with no regard to the careers of his friends led to a drift between him and his other creative half Charls. Then he bankrolls his fans for mediocre content, which is telling since Charls had no involvement with him till this year.",

If you are a type of person who is genuinely open minded, and willing to see both sides, then there is no need to have a discussion with a massive amount of people like that.

Very rarely is a debate between strangers worth anything.\nEvery time there is a massive hatemob like this, it's because everyone has made up their minds already, and want to scream and yell and party with everyone else who agrees with them.\nI think Simmons is a fucking creep weirdo, but I don't think he's done anything illegal, and I genuinely don't think it's at the level of actual honest to god pedophilia.",

There's no way to recover from this.\n\nBut yeah, twitter trannies just love to rush to conclusions and probably won't care when simmons kills himself.\n\nSam might even get sued for defamation for all of the TTS and the implications he made in the show, pedophilia defamation is one of the easiest cases to win, and simmons already has recordings of people calling him a literal pedophile.",
