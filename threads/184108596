                "comment": "LIFE AFTER FISHTANK\n\n>Simmons and Mauro: Literally nothing. Simmons has vanished and Mauro has already failed to capitalize on his barely there crumb of clout. So boring he's not even invited to the spergy fishtank twitter spaces anymore. \n\n>Vance: Will see a temporary boost of engagement on twitter, may try his hand at youtube again but quickly give up when his videos all bomb and fail to break 5k views despite Sam and Jet promoting them. Will become a full time uber driver\n\n>Sylvia: Has no fanbase or dedicated haters, will return to making her shit music in obscurity. \n\n>Josie: Will attempt to be an e-girl for at least a week after she's eliminated, tries to sell art commissions and merch before she deletes everything and disappears.\n\n>Letty: Will become a full time twitch streamer. First show about her time on Fishtank will hover between 500-1k and peak at 2k. Will settle down to 50-150 regular viewers depending on what she's doing. Will badmouth Sam and the show when it's over.\n\n>Damiel: Will go back to being a frycook and one of Sam's wigger henchmen4hire\n\n>Jon: Will maintain the largest and most consistent following post show made up of mostly /pol/tards and kiwitrannies. Will sell more e-bikes than Josie sells drawings. Will be very active on Instagram. The redpilled retard act will grow stale after a few weeks and his \"fans\" will move on to the next hot meme. Most likely fish to get hired by Sam/Jet to work on something with them in the future.",

Even a bad imitation has the potential to be hilarious since it's Jon. He could have just walked around reading the Bible outloud and it still would have worked. I have a feeling the producers watched Vance and said \"We gave Mr. Boring carte blanche and he ended up full-sending the lunatic bit, can you imagine the dude who already likes to behave ike one?\".\n\nAnd before anyone says that Jon wanted to avoid making fun of mental disorders, he apparently had no problem finding it funny when Vance was the one pretending. But all of a sudden it's a big issue when he has to do it?",

He was bullied relentlessly due to being really fucking autistic, think Brad Pitts character from 12 Monkeys. Was just really really weird\nThen he hit puberty and ended up looking exactly like pewdiepie, no shit. All the bitches ended up wanting his dick and he was suddenly super popular. He still was autistic, and with his new found power he started calling his friend his \u201cbruh chillians\u201d (a play on the word \u201cBrazilian\u201d). He was so fucking weird but it was refreshing seeing his popular friends tolerating the extremes to this and then realizing they really weren\u2019t above you in any way.\nMost extreme thing he did was pants a girl and cop a feel in the middle of a crowded hallway. He kept calling her a \u201cbruh chill\u201d while trying to make some sort of point, perhaps a punchline to a joke? Oh she cried, and yeah people grabbed him and ripped him off. But she fucking LAUGHED as if she was embarrassed and slightly inconvenienced, not like she was almost raped\nHe got away with fucking dancing on tables and even publically shitting in a cafeteria trash can. That guy pushed all the limits his looks could\u2019ve afforded him I shit you not",
