The fact is letty is the EXACT type of girl that caused frank to try and in minecraft himself with a bottle of pills. Letty had her claws in jon, fucking ella, and even vance to a certain extent with that pillowtalk. She probably got him to worry about how it looked to his gf back home, considering he didn't want to sleep in the same room as her in the first week. Then once he did, she got him into a flirty conversation AND got him to admit he's a fucking /mu/tard.\nLetty's power level is fucking unreal bros",

There's nothing particularly interesting to see here for the scientific community. It's just trash television and you're overhyping it into something more than it is. What precisely of substance do you think can be gleaned from this show that scientists aren't already aware of? It's about as useful as Road Rules footage is.\n\nThe only thing I can grant is that this sort of setup(the house and cameras) could be useful for scientific research of some kind in the future if they can pinpoint something they actually want to examine or study, but Fish Tank itself isn't useful in any way.

I swear to God, the most heavenly high is gargling that wonderboy\u2019s nuts while going fist deep into his shitter. I had Damiel screaming in the sheets with head too ridiculous to ignore. That nigga frotted my cock until he busted on my mouth, I had to return the favor. That nigga Damiel and I been fucking non-stop ever since, but keep that shit on the DL. He does that shit for free. If you\u2019re gonna ask me how to \u201clong\u201d the Bummy Buster, I\u2019ll be deadass. All you gotta do is ask, be straight up, and get physical real quick. Touch his nuts, get on ya knees, talk your shit. He doesn\u2019t play around with no pansy-ass niggas either. He likes his men manly, and his dick thick. Dark skin, 6\u20195 is the minimum and I ain\u2019t talking about height boy.\nThat nigga Damiel stole my heart and drank my seed.",

He has turned this project into his personal Friend House while he tries to get with an already taken 21 year old Native American girl. It is beyond pathetic watching him either stand near her, or walk into her room at the most random of times.\nAs far as I'm concerned, the only reason Josie is in that house is because Jet wanted to have a crack at her after he realised she knew who he was, and after discovering her Instagram (after it was leaked here) and realising she has a boyfriend, now has no idea what to do. Don't get me wrong, I would prefer Josie wins, but she has been put through 1/10 of what the other people in that house have.",

He got absolutely embarrassed and some tiny rail thin white guy yelled in his face that he shoved his white boy dick down LTG's throat and LTG just took it and backed off. LTG talks hard and he's a stereotypical angry black guy but he has 100% cuck genes in person. There's many more examples like his girlfriend of the time laughing in his face when he threatened to punch someone in real life and telling him he's a pussycat and wouldn't do a damn thing. He just looked annoyed and turned off his stream.\n\nThe guy is a pushover nerd, he's just in shape.",

I'm more annoyed that the fish are effectively discouraged from plotting against one another because they need to \"work around\" so many other personalities. There's very little predictability in their day-to-day now (which isn't even centered around them, the stars) so why bother? The baby-snatching incident was the peak of the show and the fallout thereafter was the amazing. They need to be the focus of the show again if they want to replicate that.

The past 25 days has completely undone that, particularly the first two weeks where the depression and loneliness Id learn to bury resurfaced. I\u2019ve started trying to channel it all into self improvement and I hope I can keep it up.\nI don\u2019t know how old you are but as someone who\u2019s starting the passage of time and the idleness of my own actions, let me tell you it never gets better, it will get worse and whatever anxiety you are feeling now needs to be used to enact momentum and change.

Right NOW. You don't even know how many NEETs would burn down the entire world to be able to do things over at 19 again. You have no idea how fucking stupid you're being.\n\nGet your head out of your ass immediately. Spend at LEAST one month of pure effort trying to turn some shit around whether it's your weight, your license, your work situation, your education, anything. EVERYTHING is fixable at the point you're at. EVERYTHING. You can have a great life if you just stick to solving your problems now. The more you put it off, the harder it will get.\n\nPlease, for the love of fucking god, do not delay and KNOW, not think, but KNOW THAT YOU ARE BEING A COMPLETE RETARD BY THINKING IT WAS OVER AT AGE 19. Every fuckup has been there and ALL of us know that we were being COMPLETE retards thinking this and want to beat up our old selves for getting paralyzed.",

I tried doing study, a job, socialising but at the sightless hint of failure or difficulty I\u2019d retreat into myself. This was fed back to me by the same paralysing fear that you describe which I relate to a lot. \nI\u2019m now 26 and still in the exact same position as you. Like I said in my previous comment I though I conditioned myself to this but I haven\u2019t, and that paralysis has nestled itself inside the grey matter of my brain and is a bitch to get out once your brain calcifies.\nIt\u2019s good you\u2019re thinking like this now, don\u2019t get me wrong. You do have time my friend, you just need to use it wisely. Chip away at the bullshit inside your head keeping you down, it\u2019s doing nothing for you and it\u2019s literally worthless. Keep yourself disciplined over time, push yourself to do better. Seriously man, you\u2019re still young, you have so much to give you have no idea.",

Life sucks. \nYou have to be conditioned to achieve things since a young age. Start doing something early. For me it feels like everything is too late now.\nI don't want to blame my parents for all the shit that happened but their alcoholism didn't help a younger me to find meaning in something.",
