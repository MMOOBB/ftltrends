This act however has the interesting effect of signaling attainability to incels who thinks an autistic, outcast girlfriend is someone who would potentially accept their broken selves as a partner. Which, we all know isn't true, but this is what they keep telling themselves. In reality though, Josie has a vast selection of dudes to pick from and she will and has fucked some of them. Josiecels aren't unique, there's lots of guys who fall for her act. That's the whole point of the act.\n\nShe pretends to be shy and the shy girl effect offers a blank canvas that men can project desirable traits on. Since she doesn't display a real personality, you can fool yourself that her personality is whatever you want it to be. Josie could be perceived as being friendly and kind and caring; even though her real personality, that you barely know anything about, could be the complete opposite.\n\nAll of these illusions will fall apart eventually. She will probably reveal she's fucked tons of guys. She'll start forgetting about her autism act and will start toning down her so-called stimming because she can't keep it up 24/7. She will be letting parts of her personality shine through and it will be fundamentally gross, like the discovery that she's a wannabe nigger and a bully and an attention whore.\n\nAnd as much as Josiecels love her now they will feel betrayed and start hating her when their delusions fall apart. She's just a vapid attention whoring zoomer who tries way too hard to be a TikTok meme, but incels will demonize her the same way they formerly idolized her. Why? Because what she shrewdly offered them, was a hope that she was someone who could accept them for who they are. But it was all a lie. And Josie wasn't real. Josie was a predator. And Josie preys on incels.",

Looking forward to see how they shit on her tomorrow.\n\n>Lance takes everyone's things and throws them in the basement. Then locks himself in B4\n>Jet and crew tell Letty to form an alliance with Lance\n>Damiel notices his new shoes are gone and immediatly runs up stairs to blame Letty\n>Letty asks Lance if he knows where the shoes are\n>Lance says no, and Letty believes him\n>Dam chimps out and throws a bunch of Letty's stuff in the porta potty\n>Everyone finds out that it was Lance that did everything and not Letty, and Jet brings everyone into B2 to talk it out\n>Damiel says that Letty should have been more clear, she should have left the room and talked to him face to face\n>Letty says she was afraid of Damiel cause he was going crazy. She was afraid he was gonna hit her\n>Dam says that she would think like that since her EX used to beat her, (Letty mentioned this when drunk 1 night) and that she's crazy\n>Josie asks why she would trust Lance, a guy who's only been there a couple days over Dam\n>Everyone gangs up on Letty and Letty leaves\n>Dam gives more excuses and dodges responsibility for his actions\n>Dam asks, \"Was that abusive what I did? Like, really?\"\n>Josie and Sylvia both say no and keep enabling him to be shitty\n>Chat turns on Josie calling her a bully\n>Josie goes to bathroom confessional and says, \"I was just giving my point of view. I didn't do anything. I guess you guys want me to apologize but I'm not good at that so I'm not gonna.\"\n>Proceeds to go back to doing nothing",

                "comment": "THE PSYCHOLOGY OF JOSIECELLS\n\nJosie fakes autism and fakes being an outcast, despite clearly being super social and able to effortlessly blend in, plus, having multiple boyfriends. This act however has the interesting effect of signaling attainability to incels who thinks an autistic, outcast girlfriend is someone who would potentially accept their broken selves as a partner. Which, we all know isn't true, but this is what they keep telling themselves. In reality though, Josie has a vast selection of dudes to pick from and she will and has fucked some of them. Josiecells aren't unique, there's lots of guys who fall for her act. That's the whole point of the act.\n\nShe pretends to be shy and the shy girl effect offers a blank canvas that men can project desirable traits on. Since she doesn't display a real personality, you can fool yourself that her personality is whatever you want it to be. Josie could be perceived as being friendly and kind and caring; even though her real personality, that you barely know anything about, could be the complete opposite.\n\nAll of these illusions will fall apart eventually. She will probably reveal she's fucked tons of guys. She'll start forgetting about her autism act and will start toning down her so-called stimming because she can't keep it up 24/7. She will be letting parts of her personality shine through and it will be fundamentally gross, like the discovery that she's a wannabe nigger and a bully and an attention whore.\n\nAnd as much as Josiecells love her now they will feel betrayed and start hating her when their delusions fall apart. She's just a vapid attention whoring zoomer who tries way too hard to be a TikTok meme, but incels will demonize the same way they formerly idolized her. Why? Because what she shrewdly offered them, was a hope that she was someone who could accept them for who they are. But it was all a lie. And Josie wasn't real. Josie was a predator. And she preys on incels.",
