They just took their audition tapes at face value and thought they would get a bunch of unhinged autists against each other, but in reality they got spergs.\n\nCastings for these shows are really fucking hard because you need to sniff out correct personalities. Usually you need an even match of men vs women and you need normies vs nerds vs assertive and shy people and so on.\n\nRight now you have all socially awkward people who are embarassed to do almost anything with exception of the obvious plant Damiel.",
