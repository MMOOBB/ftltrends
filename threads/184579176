                "comment": "I was trying to sleep, but started thinking about some shit. The whole Sylvia was acting bit was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The situatiom was unique in that for the first time she was being called a hog by a real person and not a disembodied voice from the walls. There was a meter rising and the chat wanted to see Frank Hassle bully the fish. She was the obvious choice considering her obvious insecurity about her weight. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, she has has been pretty diligent in letting us know that she's only 160lbs and that she signed up for this, bros.. but this time she seemed to be all over the place. She left the bed exactly where Frank dropped it for hours while she flirted with him and tried to bribe him into bullying Letty. When he finally declined her she just sat there brewing in the sexual tension and tried to get the condom on Frank's schlong. Now, whether or not she was horny from the get-go, it's obvious that she was in heat. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that Sylvia perceived how the whole thing looked, and went apeshit on him as a cope for being negged so hard. She started screaming and yelling so she could later claim she was just acting to fuck with the fish. She won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that she could do, have a meltdown and pretend she was pretending. This shit even had Vance and Josie wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Sylvia is THE only truly piglike character on this piece of shit show. Chris has been watching everything, screamed at Sylvia in person for a while after she turned her tusks toward him, and already admitted that she has no respect for him and thinks that she is being both fat and rude at the same time. She truly is the hog of the realm.",

Later in the night while everyone got drunk, Frank started Hassling Sylvia with an assist from the constant TTS bullying. Sylvia was clearly attracted to Frank and it was later revealed that Sylvia not only already knew who frank was but pays his Gumroad. Frank did not give a fuck and stole her stole her bed to sleep, leading to sylvia getting really uncomfortably close and touchy and rapey. This would escalate to frank blocking the stairs so sylvia couldn't get back up and sylvia screaming and crying and almost smacking frank with a pipe at like 1:30 AM (Frank stole the pole instead). \nHearing Sylvia drunkenly meltdown over something kind of small in comparison to what he privately cried to frank about earlier eventually had him scream and cry at her even louder until everyone went to bed and Chris locked himself in the bathroom with scissors and sang to himself. Sylvia tried to claim she was just fucking with everyone but it's an obvious lie in my opinion. There will be hell tomorrow when everyone wakes up hungover. That's about the last I saw of it.\nOh, also, frank left shitty toilet paper in the trash and spat on letty's bed a lot",

Pretty much every time Sam shows up he can't even manage to remember what he's supposed to fucking say and has to ask Jet if he forgot anything. On top of that Jet is usually dressed as the red shark and has to play mute which makes it extra awkward. How hard is it for a fucking entertainer in his 40's to remember a couple of lines, for fucks sake?",

The challenge of them being chained together proved that. \n2, Vance is a wet blanket he does nothing unless told for over an hour he needs to do something and even then he still fucked it up.\nLast nights House President election as proof. \n3, Josie has already said she is very happy already with the amount of Fishbucks she has and it will kickstart her life, anything more is a bonus. I think she doesn't have the self-confidence or self-belief to think she can win, she tried to be more vocal and out going twice before and the first time Sam told her the viewers prefer her to be quiet, seen not heard that she should focus on that. The second time was Vance, Letty and Damiel betraying her. She made the camp counsellor day fun, stuff going on but when they took over it just went back to sleeping all day doing nothing.\nShe has no motivation to do anything now if you've been watching. \n4, Sylvia honestly thinks she has fans and is in with a chance to win the show which she might if she's the \"Plant\" and really a friend to MDE guys so is just sleeping and doing nothing and when awake she just seethes.\n4, Letty is a manipulative girl, she ruined the trust by going too hard to fast people saw her personality for what it was. The locked in Bedroom 2 conclusion was the proof, Jon called her out for it but everyone else saw what she tried to do instantly fuck over Josie.",

They keep pumping in the freeloaders thinking it'll make it more fun but it's just doing the opposite.\nThe show has stopped being about the Fish, there's way too many annoying freeloaders now that steal the show and fish just try to \"lay low\" because Sam and the crew telegraph every move and they're all familiar with them anyway.\n\nFirst 2 weeks were honestly the best because it felt effortless and natural, now they're trying artificially stir up content but it just doesn't feel right.",
