The others deserve to be constantly berated and broken including Josie who just has a \"quirky\" veneer but is just as bad as the rest of them.

Hasan is a faggot nail painter, sure, but Sam is a bloated nigger jew who barks whenever his ego is touched. Hasan at the very least is a grifter. Sam doesn't stand a chance against someone his size who hasn't ruined their body internally. You're coping if you think anything otherwise. He literally avoids showing his nasty roid gut and hit's genuine retards to \"assert\" his role.\nHasan would lay that kike nigger out but the contract probably said \"no roids for 6 months\"",

The other link is from a video he made on his YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISEXvsObDJ4&ab_channel=SimmonsZhu\n\nSeems to confirm that he was just giving advice (that he likely pilfered from these other YouTube channels) to campers on how to get a boyfriend/girlfriend. This is also the origin of the soundbite where he apparently said it was fine to kiss kids, which is like the book blown out of proportion.",
