His character is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of human psychology most of his traits will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Jon's sigma outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from manosphere grifter videos, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his quotes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Jon truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Jon's ironic catchphrase \"I am a gift from God,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to the Ge'ez Book of Enoch. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jet Neptune's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.\nAnd yes, by the way, I DO have a Jon fishtank t-shirt. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",

This is a no bully zone. You can\u2019t talk about her onlyfans either because then she\u2019ll quit the show - even though she\u2019s the most boring person and will be the next to leave.\n>No you can\u2019t call out Vance for his Bernie supporting blm gf. That\u2019s crossing the line.\n>No you can use slurs against damiel or call him gay.\n>And absolutely no mean words allowed against Josie. Jet has a crush on her and she bri gs in too much money.\n>Oh, letty? That ugly whore. Fucking demon I hate her\nI bet frank hassle will get this as his briefing too, before he is \u201cunleashed\u201d. Al the low hanging fruit - a retard with a speech impediment, a fat pig with an onlyfans, a spic twink who only has two modes (lazy or nigger), a weirdo injun, a balding normie. Frank will be warned not to antagonize any of these people. Sam will tel him to go after letty though, because Sam wants to fuck letty and he has some weird psychological thing. Or maybe Sam thinks it\u2019s based and redpilled to hate women like letty (which it sort of is, but not any more than it is to hate on the other contestants, so the disproportionate hate for letty is irrational)",

Sam is pissed (no pun intended), because who would want to fuck something as vile as letty. How dare she make Sam want to fuck her. \nAnd she\u2019ll use her magic to get to Jon easily, and that\u2019s why Sam is trying to protect Jon. The worst thing that can happen to Jon is for him to fall in love with letty and become obsessed with her piss magic. Sam wants Jon to be some sort of protege as well, seemingly, so that\u2019s another reason to protect Jon from letty\u2019s warlock magic. \n\nSam should have kept pushing the \u201cforce Vance and letty into romantic situations\u201d angle. That would have been funny. Letty would have got to vance eventually in some way. That would also accomplish the task of keeping letty away from Jon. Also, Vance is pretty boring and it would spice up his entertainment value. The piss witch must torment a man\u2019s soul. She is currently tormenting sam and Jon, slowly causing them to fall under her haze. She needs to be directed towards Vance.",

If a 100 lb woman has 1 liter of piss in her bladder, and a 200 lb woman has 1 liter of piss in her bladder; proportionately speaking, the 100lb woman has twice as much piss. Letty has piss in her veins. The high concentration of piss becomes refined over time and forms a new substance with finer qualities. This gives her a type of aura (a piss aura) and the fumes seep into the pores of those around her, gradually causing them to fall under her sway. The piss residue sinks it\u2019s way ito the deepest recesses of your mind, body, and spirit. Even when letty is not around, the piss is still inside you, tormenting you, causing you to want to fuck her. \nVery dangerous. If one were to give into the piss then he would be obsessed, like a zombie, fully subordinate to the piss. Sam is able to see the signs. He is trying hard to resist the urge to fuck letty - for even a pump and dump would cause him to succumb to her magic. Sam also knows how catastrophic it would be to Jon if he were to fall for this, so he has to protect Jon.\nThis is not about \u201cfunny gameshow ha ha\u201d anymore. This is a code red situation. Letty is a category 5 piss witch, and the producers don\u2019t know how dangerous this situation is",
