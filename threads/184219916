Another way to think about it would be that since the victim has no standing to pursue criminal charges, it would make it messy to have them wait for the state to make out the case and have the defendant found criminally liable for whatever, before being able to launch their case. Australia's legislative forte is having 100 different trifling schemes and systems that like 8 citizens are aware of, allowing the government to serve as tardwranglers basically, and capping the big bare bones stuff that is bread and butter in most common law countries, such as torts, so citizens can't go around suing each other and shitting up the courts",

I have seen cases involving medical negligence fall under the civil liability act, so it would be capped, but there's probably some adjacent acts that overlap on that subject matter that I am unaware of. Junior doctors don't earn all that much here (like 120k aud which is really low given the time and effort), hence the insurance industry existing at all for them. I guess for more senior doctors why bother self-insuring when your rates would be so low since you're experienced, and already signed up.\n\nI'm glad I'm putting the wasted years of my life in law school to use; are you also a lawfag?",

You fat FUCKS always say \u201cCanadians are obsessed\u201d, but let me tell you something you ignorant school shooting, Mexican/black, OBESUM, and unclean and uneducated faggots; you would be \u2018obsessed\u2019 too if you were next to a disgusting and FAILED abortion of a country.\n\nI\u2019m PROUD of being Canadian. I\u2019m proud of the fact that I\u2019m NOT AMERICAN. Every Canadian worth his salt, syrup and Timbits is proud of this\n\nWe have lots of immigrants in this country. And I can tell you with full confidence that I\u2019d prefer 1,000,000,000 of each over a single American ANY day of the week. The moment somebody makes the choice to come here over the disgusting pile of REFUSE that is \u201cover there\u201d, they are by default SUPERIOR.\n\nAll of you had stupid spic parents that simply weren\u2019t smart enough to come up here, and are of low class TRASH from all of your respective countries. And that\u2019s a fact\n\nIn Canada you can be anything without the pain of being judged like you would in the capitalist aids-ridden hellhole down south. There is no such thing as crime here. There is no such thing as poverty here. No such thing as starvation. No such thing as sexual assault. And most of all, no such thing as being an AmeriFUCK.\n\nHell, I\u2019m Canada you can be anything without the pain of being judged. You could literally be a purple goblin with a dildo on you forehead with sparkles and shit covering your feet and people would STILL understand, that\u2019s how we roll, that\u2019s what makes us superior.\n\nAnything would be better as an alternative than being an American fuck up.\n\nFuck America and FUCK all the Americans reading this fucking comment",
