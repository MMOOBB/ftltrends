They adjusted to even that pretty quick. \nVance being awkward actually made him feel awkward eventually and he cucked and put his shit in the basement. He can fuck with people's shit but can't take it himself (and I know that doesn't matter from the POV of the show being about torturing the contestants and fairness doesn't matter)\nThen he totally SHRINKS when Lance comes back because Lance gets physical. And then he loses the stare down that LANCE initiated. Then he fake chimps out and leaves.\n\nWhat a fat piece of shit. His entire thing revolved around touching the women and that was it.",

We would still feel pain and bleed, but would be ageless and regenerate given enough time. We would eventually incorporate bloodletting and hardcore ryona and guro fetish play into our sexlife (accelerated by her existing fetish). We would cut pieces from each other as casually as normal lovers caress and kiss. We would cut each other's tongues until our mouths were leaking copious amounts of blood and kiss to mix our life essence up in the embrace of our mouths, the mixture spilling from our locked lips down her petite breasts and my chest. We'd knock out each other's teeth to be able to kiss more deeply and more readily spill blood down our thirsty throats. Sharing an excess of bloody foreplay, because we are not just ageless and timeless but because it's fun. When I finally entered her most sacred place she would be thoroughly wet not just between her legs but in the form of streaks of blood all over her, leaked from her spilled intestines and mangled breasts, and the wide gashes all over my body that she opened through a combination of a dull knife and her own wild, lusty abandon. My throbbing member would probe the deepest reaches of her perfect sex as our bodies slipped together where new blood joined us, and stuck together where old blood clotted. I would make the depths of my affection known to her all throughout even as our nether regions ached with pleasure and the rest of our linked bodies ached with every form of pain there is. At the moment of mutual climax I would literally place my palm against her convulsing, exposed womb and gaze into her one remaining eye as she gushed her arousal fluids on to my pelvis and I emptied my seed in her. In that moment we would slit each other's throats and \"sleep\" peacefully, before waking next to each other immortally renewed.",

Also the house of my dick but even moreso the first three, because I DO love her genuinely and truly and romantically, apart from just lust, but it cannot be claimed that I don't also want to ravish her with all the lust (and love) I can muster. That last point simply cannot be understated. Oh, Hark! I would make such sweet and furious love to her and directly impart into her through our shared electricity and psycho-sexual connection allllll of that love and desire and cause a SUPERNOVA to go off in her heart and her soul and her womb that sends shockwaves from her pretty raven silk adorned head to the tips of her curling toes! Our souls meeting at the most intimate docking point, an eternal synchronous convergence! Again, and again, and again!",

ALL golden moments:\n\n- fishes forced to listen to his standup. \n- his roast\n- his baiting the tts \"your mom\" x1000 \"wooow\" x100. just stupid at first, but he stuck to it all night and it eventually became funny\n- his debate with vance\n- his second roast right before he left\n- countless amounts of witty comments in-between that made me kek\n\nhe wasn't always in the limelight, but when he was, he burned bright. great addition to the show. and the whole \"break the fishtank\" thing that everyone here bought into, was a bit confirmed by how he, sam, and jet played into it during his exit today.",
