Everything else in the trailer was like a joke or immediate red-flag, whereas she was a sweet, innocent, ambiguously raced angel with snakebites, red eye makeup and clear autistic tendencies. This is when we all still thought she was Asian. It seems so long ago. I can't believe there are only 7 days left. I don't want things to change. I want Josie to stay in the tank so I can watch her forever. I don't want her to leave and go back to her normal life and disappear from my sight forever. Or to stream on twitch. I don't want to see her being pestered and simped over in real time 1 on 1 by a bunch of twitch chat orbiters.\n\nI don't want things to change.",

Like, I will basically feel obligated to try and worm my way into her life if she's actually on twitch and it's possible I won't be able to while others will. I'll have to see myself fail at doing so while others succeed and at that point she goes from being unobtainable and distant like she is now to being vaguely, possibly, the smallest percent chance obtainable. But not for me, I'll fail to get Josie and then I'll have TRULY failed, it'll truly be over for me. I'm seriously concerned how disastrous this could be to my mental health. Or do I just suck it up and accept that there's no possibility and pretend she doesn't exist after all this? Not even glance at her twitch streams. That might be the best option. Give up before I even began without even humoring the idea that she's a person that I can see live and interact with.",

I haven't dm'd her on reddit or instagram because I don't use either and that seems like a waste of time anyway, she's going to come back to the internet and have 1000 dms on insta. My point about her being unobtainable is not that it excites me, it's that there's solace in the fact she's unobtainable because that applies all over. When she returns to the net and begins streaming on twitch, most likely to something like 100 viewers at best given some time, she will no longer be unobtainable and then the very real onus and expectation is on me to try and obtain her, which I'm not confident I can actually do, which is a heartrending thing to think about.",

It seems like she really feels obliged to please the crowd because she (from what I have seen of her through a fucking 240p webcam and her tweets that have been posted) wants people to like her. I actually genuinely hope that she meets some nice people and even makes more friends through FTL (either people online that have seen her around or fans) because she genuinely seems like an okay person, and on a good path in life when this is over in 7 days.\n\n>>185215235\nShe needs to get as far away from Jet et al as possible.

She just didn't have a public before because she isn't hot enough to make it on looks alone.\nTo be honest, she's smart enough to understand that playing a innocent \"kawaii\" girl is what made her reach the top 3 and possibly win this shit.\nShe's not stupid, and very likely to be as manipulative as any other girl who step foot in that house.",
