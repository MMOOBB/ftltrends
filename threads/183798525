They got pretty close to the golden formula with these contestants, which is the only thing the production team has done right so far. An ideal and improved setup would be something like:\n- 3 BPD ethot type girls like Letty who are always trying to be the center of attention\n- 3 quirky girls like Josie for simps to war over\n- 3 good looking meathead dudes for the BPD girls to fight over and manipulate\n- 3 retarded or always online type dudes(bonus points if they're some minor e-celeb)",
