Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, Retardmonkey. I don't know what people recommend these days.\n2. Install this userscript: https://github.com/rcc11/4chan-sounds-player/releases -\n3. Optional: Install 4chanx already. https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x\n4. Refresh the page.\n\nFor making soundposts, remember that 4chan normally doesn't allow sound files, the way you get around that is separate the sound and image/video files. if you're doing a webm, make a copy of it and then have it be the sound only. Upload the sound to a third party site like https://www.catbox.moe/. Then you need to run it through the URL encoder in 4chan sound. (you'll find it in tools.) Then you just paste the encoded URL into the file name of the image/video file you're using and include anything else you see. An example of that is the file in this thread, ala [sound=files.catbox.moe%2Fqw0u07.mp3].\nMake sense?\nIf you need help editing Webms, use Webms for Retards.\nhttps://github.com/WebMBro/WebMConverter/releases",
