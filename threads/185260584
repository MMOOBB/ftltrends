The weight added some trouble as does the chair but non-obese humans can walk basically nonstop even without sleep for like 72 hours. I used to be a delivery man running all day to finish early and I wasn't even in shape, but I would run 10 hours straight while carrying awkward, large objects, get drunk, not even sleep, then keep doing the same thing for a few more days in a row. Both Josie and Vance have had this kind of job before too, so this is not something where someone is just going to pass out or anything. It's actually not going to end until a producer just walks in.\n\nYou can tell Jet and the crew have never worked real jobs and are just cryptorich niggers since they thought \"move for 12 hours\" was going to be impossible.",

He kept sending her sex letters and following her and she dropped out of the school it was so bad.\nThese are the unintended consequences of autism. Does Chris do this? Yes. \nAsking Letty for a kiss, while being completely naked and cornering her over and over in every bedroom of the house was bad enough. However, I would bet that Chris has went way over the line before with other women we dont know about because he doesnt 'understand boundaries'.",
