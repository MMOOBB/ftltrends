But this show is so good, the website and the idea for this show is genius and i hope it does well and they make a second season. I hope Sam makes things right with Simmons and i hope people don't use this Simmons stuff to destroy Sam Hyde and Fish tank because this is the best thing Ive seen in ages. Everything Sam Hyde does is Awesome, Ive been a fan for a long time. Hopefully this doesn't ruin him.\nWhat do you guys think?",

In Sam's humour, CP and pedophilia were mentioned before in skits and bits (something along the lines of when her tits are big enough, she's old enough for the D).\nThe actual crux of this whole drama is that Sam and Co. instigated a witch hunt against Simmons for flimsy evidence and Sam Hyde fans ate it up and ate now sending death threats to Simmons while they happily ignore that - by Sam's own measure - he himslef is way creepier than Simmons because he actually had sexual contact with a 16 yo when he was 29. \n\nThis is not about trying to cancel Sam for the Marky shit. This is about pointing out that Sam wasn't in the position to label Simmons as a pedo on these flimsy grounds given his past and his style of humour. The fact that Sam was just going with the flow of a twitter cancel mob adds to this.\nI don't care about kiwitroon shills out to cancel Sam or Sam Hyde fans sucking his cock. I just want people to know that Simmons was wronged and it irks me that he's being slandered as a pedo because he's small and defenseless and some mob ganging up on him for fun is tatseless at best. \nThat's only me though, idk if other posters have different agendas.",

Sam Hyde has sissified himself on camera more times than we've seen Simmons do it. While Simmons crossdressed a minimum of 2 times, Sam Hyde has been in drag many times, he has played gay characters, made out with transsexuals for a sketch that he wrote.\nNothing Simmons did with the baby doll was weird while Sam Hyde has repeatedly for years made ''ironic'' jokes about age play, pretends to be a baby and talks about how he has mommy issues and needs to be treated like a baby. There's no evidence of Simmons ever behaving inappropriately around children while Sam has fucked at least one.\n\nIf Simmons just got kicked out because no one likes him and he is some weirdo who gets too touchy with Jon and acted way over line when he was in drag, that would be fine. But don't pretend this is some kind of moralfag crusade where you care about kids.",

The captions aren't from Simmons view point, it's meant to be what the viewer is thinking to make a connection, that's basically marketing 101.",
