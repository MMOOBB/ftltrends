                "comment": "Women get less out of penovaginal sex than men since their primary erogenous zone isn't even in the vagina.\n\nOnly about 20% of women reaching orgasm by penetration alone.\n\nWomen pay for sex exceptionally rarely. E.g., from a Swiss survey: 30% of men, but NOT ONE out of one thousand surveyed women (0%!) have paid for sex.\n\nFake scam dating ads almost exclusively target straight men: strong evidence of higher male libido.\n\nTinder usage is correlated with lower self-esteem for men but not women.\n\nAverage women receive 15 times as many matches as average men on Tinder.\n\nMost online dating sites are dominated by men: only 21% of Tinder users are female.\n\nWomen are statistically more attracted to men who are already in relationships than single men.\n\nMen are 8x more likely than women to regret passing up casual sex (28.9% M, 3.6% F). I.e., women have higher action regret, while men have higher inaction regret.\n\nAccording to a trial by Fisher (2012), published in the Journal of Sex Research, men think about sex on average 34 times a day, whilst women thought about sex 19 times a day, i.e. men on average think 1.8 times as often about sex.\n\nMen reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and when asked to estimate the actual frequency of their experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week).\n\nNot only is women's sex driver lower, but women are also reproductively unavailable 10-15% of the time due to menstruation. Moreover, all men aged 20 to 60 prefer women in their 20s and the proportion of old men is growing due to falling birth rates (leading to an aging overall population) and a slightly higher birth rate of males. Hence, lots of men compete for few fertile, sexually available and young women.\n\nThere are now roughly 70 MILLION excess men in China and India who will live and die without partners, according to surveys.",

Conversely, male sexual desire was found to remain constant, or even increased throughout the course of the relationship.\n\nThe more men love their wife, the more they want to have sex with their wife. The more women loved their husbands, the LESS they wanted to have sex with those husbands.\nMen showed affection by initiating sex, sharing leisure activities, and doing housework with their wife. By contrast, women showed affection by reducing negative or antagonistic behaviors (e.g nagging less and being less annoying).",

Just nothing. Literally all you do in life is exist. Occupy space. pass the time. You're a chick.\n\nYou're bored, as usual, tweeting about your fucking hair and not even feeling any kind of happiness from it, just soothing your constant need to be bitter and cunty and petty toward other women. Every single thing you've done in the past year was mundane, shallow, and boring. You spent the last six hours reading kinda-interesting Reddit stories about people who made interesting Halloween hats for their kids or some stupid bullshit that you think is interesting and you may say is interesting but you're not really sure if it's really interesting. You're just fucking sitting there, gestating, fermenting, with a moist hole between your legs that guarantees you'll at least never have to get up and move around and work to support yourself.\n\nAnd then you see men, over in some corner, having fun. You've never seen this before. What are they even doing? Instead of their consciousnesses merely sitting in their thick skull and revolving around itself, they are imbuing their conscious energy and intentionality into external objects, crafts, goals, projects. All the bitterness and cuntiness you feel nonstop seems to be absent, as they congratulate each other for being victorious, and happily learn from someone who defeated them. These creatures are truly content to be alive. They have found purpose in a purposeless universe.\n\nAnd your gaze turns back on itself, on your self, and you realise you've never had that. You can never have it. So you get up, you walk over there, and you fucking ruin everything. Just ruin the whole fucking thing. The five seconds of attention you get will be worth destroying it. Because you're a woman.",
