The only reason she will make to F3 was because of the vast amount of bumbling from the other HGs. Given her general lack of poise and charisma I would have thought she at least had some skill at the game, but even in this regard she disappoints. She isn't even physically appealing if you are being at all honest with yourself. You losers only like her because she is so bland, so unremarkable, so unbelievably milquetoast that she might be realistically attainable for you... ah forget it\n\nCongratulations, if she wins. That's at least a 10 year supply of boxed wine and cat food. She will still never be your gf",
