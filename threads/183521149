It\u2019s lame and he didn\u2019t ruin it, you guys did.

You guys did a terrible job by releasing the other contestants info early, purposely adding friends and friends of friends to the show as contestants, improperly coding the website to the point 50k viewers cost you 30k a day, not monitoring their phone usage and only allowing them to call an emergency number during the swatting, and not having a solid plan of daily activities with actual time frames so the viewers know when to tune in, you try to blame Jon for ruining the show for being a \u2018narc\u2019. It\u2019s lame and he didn\u2019t ruin it, you guys did. Next time get actual randoms to join the game, have a solid grasp of what you\u2019re planning to do when they get there, and live up to what you tell the audience. You said no weed, no phones, unscripted. They\u2019ve smoked weed used their phones and most of the contestants are friends, friends of friends, or orbiters.\n\nThey need to stop with the fake advertising and actually start delivering. \nNo one wanted to see a try hard Millennial MDE plant take up what could've been another interesting contestant's spot.\nIt wasn't worth such a lame gag\nIt's far more interesting to see a real person tortured than one of Jet's friends.",

Only now or when MDE hit is he getting noteworthy. And he doesn't want that to happen to other young artists. He's partly right. If you're not willing to sit down for 12 hours a day DOING your craft then you're not doing enough to become a successful, money making artist.

Vance played the role of Rabbi Dracula who needed to find foreskins. After picking up Simone in his car, Simone in a high pitched voice offered help to Vance, ordering foreskins on doordash. I couldn't really watch it or understand the rest of the plot. Needless to say it was cringemaxxing. Perhaps it appealed to some, but I hated the office.\nThe audience voted about 80:20 that team Jon won. To simmons credit, he had to really put himself out there, but he basically just thought crossdressing would be funny. \n\nLetty gets upset at the L and simmons tries to comfort her. Sam kicks him out and reassures her she performed well, and says he gave him a fishbucks to talk him down from the ledge and get him back into boy clothes while simmons is eavesdropping on the conversation just outside the doorway.",

You were trying to say that Sam Hyde's comey is unfunny, then you used another person's comedy as a direct example to illustrate your point.

Think before you post.\n\n>>183522934\nBut it makes more sense for bullied people with self-esteem issues to side with the bully. Jon would be reminding them of themselves, and their own inadequacies, and siding with Damiel makes them feel empowered, even if the \"tough guy\" act is wholly ineffectual.\n\nFans of Jon recognize that he is a genuine person, albeit annoying and a little na\u00efve.
