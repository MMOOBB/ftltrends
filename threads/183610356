                "comment": "Jet Neptune had been working at the Fishtank website for several days, and he had seen it all. But when the site went down one day, he knew he had to act quickly. The company's profits depended on the website being up and running, and he was the only one who could fix it.\n\nJet worked tirelessly to get the website back up, staying up late into the night and pouring over lines of code. He was making progress, but he was getting tired. He rubbed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, taking a deep breath.\n\nSuddenly, he felt a strange energy coursing through his body. He looked up, and standing before him was Allah, the Islamic deity. Jet's third eye was opened, and he was transcended to a higher plane of existence.\n\nAll around him, he saw the world in a new light. He saw the interconnectedness of everything, the way all things were connected in a cosmic dance. He saw the beauty and the majesty of the universe, and he was filled with a sense of awe and wonder.\n\nJet knew that he had been given a gift, a new way of seeing the world that few ever got to experience. He knew that he had been chosen for a special purpose, and that he needed to use this new perspective to help others.\n\nHe closed his eyes and focused his mind, and he felt a surge of energy flow through him. He knew what he needed to do.\n\nJet returned to his work on the Fishtank website, but this time he saw things differently. He saw the website not just as a collection of code and data, but as a living, breathing entity, a manifestation of the company's mission and values.\n\nHe worked with renewed focus and clarity, and within a few hours, he had fixed the website. But he didn't stop there. He used his newfound wisdom to guide the company, helping them to see the bigger picture and to work towards a more sustainable and ethical business model.",

One day, he got hired to fix up the Fishtank website, which was all jacked up and needed serious work.\nNow, Jet was ready to get to work, but as soon as he stepped into the building, he caught a whiff of something amazing. The smell of hot dogs was wafting through the air, and he couldn't resist. See, Jet had a weakness for hot dogs. He loved 'em more than anything.\nSo instead of getting to work like he was supposed to, Jet followed his nose to the source of that delicious scent. And what do you know? There was a hot dog stand right outside the building, selling the best damn dogs in town.\nJet couldn't resist. He sauntered over to the stand and ordered up a few dogs with all the fixin's. Mustard, ketchup, relish, you name it. And let me tell you, those dogs were like heaven in a bun. Juicy, flavorful, and packed with all the right spices.\nBut as Jet was chowing down on his dogs, he couldn't help but feel guilty. He was supposed to be fixing the Fishtank website, not indulging in his hot dog addiction. So he made a decision right then and there. He was gonna finish the job, and he was gonna do it right.\nWith a belly full of hot dogs and a newfound determination, Jet got to work. He fixed up the website in no time, using all his tech skills and know-how. And when he was done, he felt like a million bucks.\nThe folks at Fishtank were thrilled with his work, and they even offered him a bonus for a job well done. Jet was over the moon. He knew that he'd made the right decision by fixing the website instead of giving in to his hot dog cravings.\nAnd yet, as he walked out of the building, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of longing for those delicious hot dogs. But he knew that he had a job to do, and that he couldn't let anything get in the way of his success. So he walked away, feeling proud and accomplished, and maybe just a little bit hungry",
