It's probably best for him to leave at this point, it's something he talks about doing frequently enough anyway. He can do retarded life advice videos like Andrew Tate does after getting out of the tank and that will be great content on its own, but him being a sourpuss and ruining any challenge he doesn't like defeats the whole purpose of the show being a competition. He needs to go, he's simply not cut out for this.",
