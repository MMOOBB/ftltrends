With a passion for film and media, she attended college to hone her skills and develop her artistic voice.\n\nJosie is a self-proclaimed anime enthusiast and has a particular affinity for Dance Dance Revolution. Her love for gaming is evident in her pink and white gaming chair, which takes pride of place in her bedroom alongside her collection of highly-regarded animated series plushies.\n\nAlthough she may come across as a little awkward at first, Josie is not easily phased. She embraces her introverted nature and uses it to fuel her creativity, producing artwork that is as unique and compelling as she is.\n\nWith her quiet determination and passion for her craft, Josie is ready to take on the world and show everyone what she's made of. Don't be fooled by her shy exterior - Josie is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone she meets.",

You have to be extra careful involving stunts and sex.\n\nWhat if Chris has a heart attack while boxing with Sam? What if one of them tripped and fell when a bunch of garbage was dumped on the floor while they were doing laps with the backpacks?

If you go over to a nudists house for dinner, they tell you they're going to get naked, and you stay, you can try and take the nudist to court but you're not winning.\n>But the law says-\nThe law says a lot of shit.

I would love to do a morning workout with Josie in which I'd run laps (with my tongue) up and down those sweaty 9.78 inches (plus the entire width, with stops between each cute toe). Let's aim for... 1000 laps a day! That's a good start! I'm pretty sure before long I'd be able to work up to 2000 a day!",

She can cope with her own pain and trauma that was inflicted on her by not only inflicting it on cute anime characters (a way of lashing out and coping without hurting anyone for real) while also seeing herself in the characters feeling a sense of relation to their outward trauma which is metaphorical for her inward trauma, the pain they are feeling, having their guts ripped out, torn out, like her innocence was torn out. And yet she's still sweat and kind to everyone she comes across, and mostly remains happy go lucky and lackadaisical, and giving to those around her, willing to help, willing to do things selflessly for others.\n\nJosie is an angel and she needs to be loved and protected at all costs.",
