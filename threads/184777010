                "comment": "Jon was so stupid for leaving, it's been clear since like day 7 that he's the favorite to win. If he just decided to toughen it out I'm 99% sure he would have won and gotten the money + real clout for his YT and business. \nHe was Sam's favorite and the audience loved him until he straight up refused to participate in the last 2 days he was there.\n\nRemember on day 2 or 3 when he talked about how Tate was on big brother, and that he'll win fishtank and toughen it out no matter what?\nIt took less than 10 days for him to go back on that and start talking about how he wants to leave. I was genuinely disappointed when I first heard him say he wants to leave, because I thought he actually would be the type to tough it out no matter what.\n\nSam and Jet are partially responsible for him wanting to leave, they couldn't get a good read on Jon and didn't notice that all the trashing of the house and the TTS was getting to him slowly. Which is also unfortunate because you can't come on a show like this and throw in the towel so early. But that's autism for you, you never know what you're gonna get.\n\nThey couldn't predict his autism would get to him like that. I think they (like many others) thought he would be tougher than that considering how much he boasted of his numerous exploits and the things he's experienced in life.\nThis culminated on that bad day where everyone was on edge from the whole baby shaking thing and where Jon was genuinely worried for Simmons getting kicked out and it showed in his behavior, he was catatonic the whole time it was happening because he knew Simmons will get kicked but not in such a brutal way with such a heavy accusation attached to it, that broke him afterwards.\n\nThe whole tone of the show changed after that because Sam didn't realize how much Jon and Simmons bonded and that it would affect a giga autist like Jon greatly if he got kicked. \n\nWhen you think about it, all of these events are just kind of a series of unfortunate circumstances.",
