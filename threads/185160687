He can't fight back against Frank in any meaningful way so all he can do is lay down and take it. The show just put him in an impossible situation. As much as I hate the guy I don't like seeing him being humiliated in this way\nVance should just walk- tell Sam to shove his 35k, do a big speech in front of the cameras about how they all fucking suck and it's all fake. Start markeyposting into the camera, burn all your bridges. Now THAT would be kino",

Her willingness to go along with shit and be the butt of the joke. Look at how she wants to go along with this shave head shit. It isn\u2019t because this is some master manipulative move, it\u2019s because Vance got a positive reaction and she thinks this will somehow win her favour with people. She\u2019s going to hate herself after this is over.",

I was there (and here) every single moment too. Now it feels natural to not be so into it, the ordeal by week 2-3 was my lowest point: dreams about the tank, going to a room in my house thinking I'm switching cameras, catching up to archived threads right after waking up, I was a mess but now I'm cured. I have a 5gb folder with over 4 thousand screencaps that I will never revisit and I don't feel anything about it.
