This act however has the interesting effect of signaling attainability to incels who thinks an autistic, outcast girlfriend is someone who would potentially accept their broken selves as a partner. Which, we all know isn't true, but this is what they keep telling themselves. In reality though, Josie has a vast selection of dudes to pick from and she will and has fucked some of them. Josiecels aren't unique, there's lots of guys who fall for her act. That's the whole point of the act.\n\nShe pretends to be shy and the shy girl effect offers a blank canvas that men can project desirable traits on. Since she doesn't display a real personality, you can fool yourself that her personality is whatever you want it to be. Josie could be perceived as being friendly and kind and caring; even though her real personality, that you barely know anything about, could be the complete opposite.\n\nAll of these illusions will fall apart eventually. She will probably reveal she's fucked tons of guys. She'll start forgetting about her autism act and will start toning down her so-called stimming because she can't keep it up 24/7. She will be letting parts of her personality shine through and it will be fundamentally gross, like the discovery that she's a wannabe nigger and a bully and an attention whore.\n\nAnd as much as Josiecels love her now they will feel betrayed and start hating her when their delusions fall apart. She's just a vapid attention whoring zoomer who tries way too hard to be a TikTok meme, but incels will demonize her the same way they formerly idolized her. Why? Because what she shrewdly offered them, was a hope that she was someone who could accept them for who they are. But it was all a lie. And Josie wasn't real. Josie was a predator. And Josie preys on incels.",

That shit had to be the tightest, yellowest, wettest boy pussy I've ever laid pipe into. I swear to God, the most heavenly high is gargling that wonderboy's nutshack while going fist deep into his shitter. I had Damiel screaming in the sheets with head too ridiculous to ignore. That chigga frotted my cock until he busted on my mouth, I had to return the favor. That chigga Damiel and I been fucking non-stop ever since, but keep that shit on the DL. He does that shit for free. If you're gonna ask me how to \"long\" Damiel I'll be deadass. All you gotta do is ask, be straight up, and get physical real quick. Touch his nuts, get on ya knees, talk your shit. He doesn't play around with no pansy-ass niggas either. He likes his men manly, and his dick thick. Dark skin, 6'5 is the minimum and I ain't talking about height boy.\nThat chigga Damiel stole my heart and drank my seed.",

All within around 20 square miles of me. That's how I got these rates per square mile.\nThis doesn't factor in race. I've only known white girls, Hapa girls, Asian girls, and Latina girls that act in any way similar to all her qualities. But it does factor in age ranges.\nSo lets use Los Angeles as an example:\n>469 square miles in LA county\n>rate of around 0.4 per square mile\n>187.6 girls similar to Josie in LA county\nWe can now take that number and find the rate per standard population:\n>population of LA country:\n>18,500,000 people live in LA country as of 2021\n>18,500,000 / 100,000\n>185\n>187.6 / 185 = 1.014\nFor every 100,000 people ANYWHERE in the USA, maybe even in many places of the world, there is likely to be at least 1 girl similar to Josie. Finding her at the correct local DDR spots is the real trick.\nJosie is a very unique girl.\nHope this was a whitepill for you anons that there is hope to find a girl *similar* to Josie.\nDo with this information what you will anons.....",

She might be a handful because she's autistic, but at least she's engaged and probably would stick by your side.\n\nLetty seems a degree more boyish and sly, though she seems engaged enough in some discussions. The porn of her and her deranged ex may allude to a more twisted personality, however ultimately she's probably fine to be around.\n\nSylvia seems quite self-centered and motivated to win on her own terms (which can be fine traits), however her obesity suggests a lack of self-control and an un-diagnosed [mental] sickness that wasn't present prior to her obesity. Her hollering is annoying and exaggerated, and she sounds like she lives in a trailer park.\n\nLettycels and Josiecels should just team up against Sylvia, who doesn't really have any backers apart from the one brapfag that constantly posts a video titled \"Sylvia_sexu.webm\" featuring Sylvia causing a minor earthquake as she jumps from the second step of the staircase. Her lack of eyebrows is particularly horrifying, and should be the second most convincing argument against her (with the first being her obesity).",

Then when Letty said everyone is a coward for not speaking up, Josie said \"well, why did you trust Lance?\"\nGiven the context, it was a horrrrible look because what Josie was talking about was Letty was hiding in bedroom 4 as Damiel was raging and Lance was the only one making her safe from Damiel after his threats and throwing her stuff in the outhouse/toilet.\nJosie said she was bullied and people see her shifting things back on Letty as given how grave the situation was.

Pretty sure he's joked about himself being a bad person to get advice from but if people are gonna pay for it fuck it why not.

At worst, his book was promoting a form of grooming, even if he was being facetious. \nBut Sam must've realized it only brought attention to his odd behavior he had in the past with a minor. And didn't want to be accused as a groomer by having Simmons on the show.\nThat's probably why they told the Fish and discord grifters to not talk about Simmons and ban it from their fag chats.",
