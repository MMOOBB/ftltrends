Asmongold is probably one of the only ones who would have done it, but doesn't now even though he's reacted to Sam before he's now owned by an agency that manages Hasan, xQC, Moistcritical and a few other streamers and they all collaborate in order to boost each other's numbers even though it may not appear that way.\nAsmongold i know you lurk here you goblin looking pussy, you used to be a full on Magatard in 2016 and now look at you, shouting out Hasan and petrified of Sam Hyde. Fuck you and the scum you hang around with Rich Campbell and Mizkif both weird fucks who rape women and cover up grooming shit the fuck is wrong with you goblin cunts.",

Not to mention, fishtank is filled with a tranny who wears rainbow sleaves, a retarded person to make Andrew Tate people look dumb, Vance is a completely nutered white guy, etc. \nAlso Sam literally did a sketch where he does a deal with the Devil. He definitely sold out and they are subtly slipping in progressive propaganda wherever they can in his content. It's whatever though, it's still better than netflix. and if you spot the propaganda you can just ignore it. \n\n>josie saying a baby chooses it's gender. \n\nHis shit is riddled with progressive programming.
