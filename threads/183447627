Terribly optimised site led to it being 8 concurrent cams to 1 on youtube being manually switched by some faggot but even if they do manage to save the site (they wont some paypiggy will payroll it for sam) theres nothing interesting about it. The fishtoys suck, everyones an introverted personality except for the 1 guy thats a plant placed in there by Jet and now since theyve had nothing planned theyve just decided it'll be content to come up and hang out with the fish every now and then and improvise a funby story. Theyve all become too close to the contestants and too empathic towards them to allow any sort of mind rape to take place. Its just a poorly setup streamer house of boring fucks.",

You can do multiple livestreams from the same channel at the same time if you need constant feed from different rooms. Or even make changing the camera a donation goal. In fact, you can tie certain redeems to superchats like streamers or camwhores do, 911 superchat dollahs to steal someone's bed, for example. Plus, a lot of paypigs have their cards tied to YT already and don't need to forward their payment info directly to Sam's chinese-owned databank. Just feels like they lost a lot of momentum.",

These are growing pains and despite the incredible hurdles they've run into they've still delivered an extremely high quality product. I'm not kidding this might be the most fun and interactive media project I've ever experienced. \nShitposting about it, meming, donating to TTS, all the drama of the technical issues, the constant 24/7 raids by leftoids, the ARG of trying to figure out who these people are. It's crazy how its seems almost curtailed to 4chan people. I'm extraordinarily thankful to MDE and Sam and Jet. They're doing great work. \nBut yeah there's some growing pains. \n>Imagine how much better this entire thing could have been if they didn't completely drop the ball every step of the way.\nI'm 100% serious, I cannot imagine this being better. It could have gone smoother, but I think the emotional ups and downs are so compelling and interesting it wouldn't actually be better if it went smoothly. \nwe'd probably have bullied Sylvia off the show already. \nnothing but gratitude from me.

One guy is lying face up with his hand on his forehead like he's just had enough. Meanwhile the retard is just sitting there with her awful slouch, intermittently bopping her head to the song.
