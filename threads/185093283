It pushed him into a mental breakdown, where Steve, one of Chris's 13 voices in his head, had to take control of his body to prevent him from going into a tard rage and killing everbody. TTS finally broke him by convincing him Mauro ate his steak. So Chris dumped mustard on Mauro. Mauro chimped out and dumped a tequila drink on Chris and then threw handsoap on him. Chris chimped out and started claiming the handsoap was bleach/caustic cleaning fluids and calling it a chemical attack. Chris ran to the basement to hide telling production he was gonna press charges against Mauro for the chemical attack. Production talked Chris down in the basement. After Chris came up the contestants were told to leave Chris alone, but production turned TTS and sound effects on in Chris's room. You are here.",

I can maybe understand thinking Mauro made a mistake and didn't know his own strength when slapping Vance, but to witness Mauros full force slap on Chris and not call him out on it makes him a full blown beta male pussy, especially given that Mauro is a fat faggot that would never be able to defend himself in a real fight. On the positive side, it makes for interesting content (we're talking about it), but the production team need to absolutely torture him, and encourage all of the other fish to do so as well.
