He was loud and retarded, sure, but he wasn't annoying, he was funny, then Jon then also became loud and retarded without being obnoxious, he became funny.\nYou know was also loud and retarded? Her older brother (who now has a wife and children, you can see him being silly on her youtube channel, video is called \"Breakfast\").\n\nShe literally has posts on reddit asking for friends because she is incapable of making IRL friends. \nWhen she started to consider Jon a friend, he got kicked out of the show.\nOf course she feels like shit.\nRegardless of her guro and self-harm shit, she is a pure person.",

                "comment": "I think if there is one single fuckup that Sam & Jet are going to regret the most it's not being rigid with the eliminations. Damiel never should have been brought back and 1 person should have been getting eliminated every week no matter what. If people left of their own volition or got kicked for infractions it shouldn't have had an effect on the weekly elimination being stopped. This would have reduced the run time of the show but I think they're now realizing that would have worked massively in their favour. \n\nIf they had actually followed their own rules then at this point the show should have 3 people left with 1 getting eliminated on Friday and next week would actually be the final week with 2 people left (and Frank Hassle joining next week for the finals would tie into everything perfectly).\n\nInstead because they decided to constantly fudge the rules, Damiel is there, there's an extra person because no one was actually eliminated week 1 (Simmons was kicked and Mauro left on his own), and they may possibly decide to not eliminate anyone on Friday either because Jon left of his own volition today.\n\nThey have completely fucked up the show and instead of it tying up nicely next week it is going to drag on for way too fucking long with way too many boring people in the house.",
