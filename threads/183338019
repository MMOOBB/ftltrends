Like any shitty TV show or reality program it's going to have its fans. I just suspect that these fans are doing their best to convince themselves they like it because they enjoy and identify with the creator; not because they actually like the show. A kind of fandom self-hypnosis. The reactions remind me of threads you'd see for any sort of live content. Comparisons to anime, waifu talk, shitty tiktok zoomer memes, etc. Sam's fans are just going through the motions, trying to keep his ego and bank account afloat until they have to convince themselves that they like WP2.",
