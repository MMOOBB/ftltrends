While you are watching the living room you're leeching their bandwidth from the basement cam which is costing them money to run and hasn't had any movement there in 3 days.\nThere are no quality options. The camera quality is fairly good for CCTV but they add a filter on top of it to make it look worse.\n\nThis shit is crazy and they have no idea what they're doing. If they simply turned off the basement camera they would reduce the cost of the stream by maybe 10%.",

TTS messages are blaring in her room calling \n\nher a fat hog and Stankypit. \nDamiel starts punching the wall of his room which wakes up Josie. Jon goes upstairs to see if they want breakfast.\n\nThe group hangs out and talks about their sleep habits. Vance congratulates Damiel on winning the skit contest, Mauro looks really happy. Josie \n\ncomes down and sits down in the spinny chair and eats her bacon while playing with her stuffed animals. \n\nThe squad retire to the couch while Simmons cleans up after Jon. Letty plays Go-fish with Jon and they talk about Andrew Tate and UFOs. A TTS prank \n\nmessage comes in and tells them that the ruins of Atlantis have been found. Everyone starts to joke about it and Jon takes it seriously. Vance looks \n\nbored. \n\nIn the afternoon Sam brings over a bucket of KFC chicken which Sylvia and Mauro look happy about. Jon refuses to eat any of the chicken but helps \n\npass out plates for everyone. Damiel goes back upstairs to sleep and Josie starts running around the couch. Sylvia lets out a huge fart that \n\neveryone pretends not to notice but Letty laughs about it. \n\nIn the evening everyone is sitting around the couch and decide to play truth of dare. Vance dares Jon to kiss Josie but he refuses so he asks him if \n\nhe ever smoked marijuana which Jon admits to only once. Sam yells on the intercom \"NO WEED\" to which the gang all laugh. Letty goes next and picks \n\ntruth, Simmons asks her if she has ever hooked up with a black guy and Letty says \"No i don't think so\". Next it's Sylvia's turn and she gets asked \n\nif she would ever do a porno which she says yes. \n\nJosie, Damiel and Mauro go upstairs to sleep. Jon stays on the couch and talks with Letty, Vance stays too.",

Why shouldn't people support independent creators they enjoy? especially if they have the money. For the price of a hamburger you can access hundreds of hours of content and download it all. You're honestly a retard not to do it, or too poor to even be talking about money.",

Twitch updates the thumbnail of the videos every few minutes.\nEvery time you look at the cameras of fishtank you are looking at 10 full quality streams and taking up 10 times the bandwidth. And surprise surprise, it turned out that it costs 10 times more to run the stream than they expected.\nIt's all bad the fault of bad optimization.\n>How can they save the stream?\nThe stream will be fine. They still make more money than they lose, this is just them mismanaging the payment. It's just a massive needless loss of money they shouldn't be losing.",
