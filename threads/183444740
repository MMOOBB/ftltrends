One common outcome of a narcissistic relationship is that the victim seems narcissistic to people outside of the relationship due to gaslighting and triangulation. I've been there, and had no support, while everyone thought my ex was a darling princess that could do no wrong. Men often get no sympathy from society when they get out of a narcissistic relationship, and that can cause you to snap and do stupid shit if you aren't aware of what happened to you. It's a real head fuck if you find yourself in a narcissist relationship without knowing anything about it.",

They are different from normal people. Lying is seen as a virtue to them and like blacks, their fathers walk out constantly. I know this sounds like a meme but it's literally true and something you need to understand if you dont want to get completely fucked over by a girl like letty. It's just how they are. And it's good to know, so you can just accept this about them and then live your life. \n\nThe same is true about Jewish dudes. They have your back if they are getting something immediately out of it. But they will not have your back out of sheer trust or friendship because you are a goy. It's just how it is.

It's truly a tragedy the enjoyment of human interaction is one of the most primal enjoyments of life. It's like not being able to see or hear. I hope one day we can devise a treatment, but we'd need to overhaul our health system in such a way that it actually attempts to make people healthy (currently it just tries to monetize their treatment for the longest time possible). \n\n>>183446661\nIt seems like you're avoiding the question. I understand and appreciate your hopefulness, I would want that in any therapist that I sought help from, I applaud you for it. But the question is, what's the most typical result. What percentage of that population go on to be able to make meaningful human connections? Certainly high functioning people have a better shot, but wouldn't you agree that most end up withdrawing into themselves? That's the tragedy of autism isn't it? That it very difficult to therapeutically treat.",

People are typically interested in mostly mundane things and it takes too long to get to a point where the \u2018we are relating to one another\u2019 stage ends and the \u2018I can begin to get comfortable with you\u2019 stage begins. Like I said, it takes me about a year of regular contact to get to what I consider an acceptable degree of comfort with another person to consider them a friends. I have met people who call others they talked to a handful of times their \u2018friends\u2019. It makes me wonder if it\u2019s normies who don\u2019t actually form strong bonds.\nand yet people do form strong bonds regularly. One night stands are common, neuro typical people can fall in love on a vacation. You might argue that is exactly how we're designed to operate. \nI understand your perspective and as an introvert I relate to it. But I've formed a strong bond with another man I was FIGHTING before. Like during a fight he and I gained mutual respect for each other, and by the end of the fight its like we were friends. \nAlot of this is also exacerbated by modern atomized living. A couple hundred years ago, almost no one was alone ever. They were ALWAYS around their extended family which had a place in their local community. Socializing wasn't something that occurred at school or work, but at all hours constantly. \nJust going back to a more local, community oriented way of life I think would help a lot of people with socializing disorders.",

If you have a disability that affects your ability to socialize, isn't it possible or likely that you don't experience social interactions the same way as they do? How do you even imagine what it's like for them?",

I guess im not sure i understand the question, i cant say a typical result because i only see people that are on the steps of overcoming them or have the self awareness to notice a problem and want to fix it. \nIts like saying \"whats the result of depressed people\"\nAvoiding medications, you can help them overcome that but theres always a chance it resurfaces. The biggesr indicator is a messes up sleep schedule leads to a depressive stage. \nSo when do you measure results? Because how i see it everyone results in death.",

In that dance you are able to decide if you like the other person or not, based on how they compliment your dancing and how they react to your complimentary dancing with them. In America this dance is especially fabricated to be as disarming as possible, which is unnerving to someone observing it without being entranced by it. That dancing does not come nearly as naturally to autistic people, and it must be learned as an adult or, if you\u2019re lucky and your parents are pretty good, a therapist will teach you as a child. Otherwise you\u2019re fucked, because you don\u2019t understand how to play and no one will teach you. \n\nI agree that it is a tragedy. I would happily give up my left but to be able to get naturally what others take for granted. And I agree about the medical industry, I call it the suffering-industrial complex. Perhaps there will be a treatment some day, but I highly doubt that a lifetime of brain development can be reversed so I\u2019m out of luck either way.",
