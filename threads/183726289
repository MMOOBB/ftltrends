Then Jon and Snorlax had a fight. Then Simmons got exposed infront of everyone and got fucked out. Then Jon had a mental breakdown over Simmons being a paedophile and just a general build up because of today and sobbed in the toilet. They all had a time out and Snorlax left. So now they are drinking and eating pizza in privacy",

He mentioned Simmons was a legal liability so he at the very least spoke to someone beforehand. Simmons was acting like he was going to self-harm or some shit after the sketch disaster, stole fishnets, wore a pedo-bear onesie (lol), and somehow when confronted about his more than questionable posts doesn't deny or explain it. He comes off as a Buffalo Bill type 100%, not sure why the defense squad is out for him when was bottom of the totem pole.

I only say this because we\u2019ve seen the last 3-4 have been gold; the house is producing good content in its own now without the need for Jason Goldstein to come in and break shit. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s hilarious when he does, but things were really starting to get good. But I know at the rate it was going, something was going to have to give. People were finally telling Jon how sick they were of him, plans and alliances were becoming a real factor, and all the elements of a good reality TV show we\u2019re falling into place. And then Sam humiliated an idiot in front of everyone (in an entertaining but shocking fashion) and scared everyone shitless. They should have simply brought Simmons down and told him what\u2019s up and he has a few minutes to get his shit and not say a word to anyone. No one would have left and there would still be intrigue and mystery. But hell, i didn\u2019t really predict everyone would be so shell shocked from it in the way they were either.",

The tension had been building and today was the release value with everyone losing their shit in each other. But that is how these shows work and they need to recoup and get their minds right without bitching out or having a mental breakdown. Also, fuck Sam for telling everyone Letty and Vance were behind it just because Jon is an idiot. Even Jet contradicted him right afterwards by telling both of them they did nothing wrong.
