By that point a man with no experience will be ensnared and probably lose at least a couple of years being emotionally tortured. It's one of those things you want to find out first hand when you're still young, so you develop an actual skill of detecting it.",

They could have used the premiere system to build hype and schedule the recaps so that they run before whatever the daily live challenge is in the house, which would bring people from youtube to their site.

This show is pretty loose in terms of rules and such and we haven't technically seen how they eliminate a houseguest from the show (though I assume the audience votes). Sam was dropped hints days leading up to Simmons being kicked that he was going home, and he's doing the same to Sylvia now by calling her out for not doing enough.\n\nSam is also giving huge shade to Letty at the moment, he clearly does not like her.",

Reality shows, especially one that partially relies on the contestants torturing each other needs to encourage duplicitous behavior and sow distrust. They're easier to control and fuck with when they're more worried about the person that sleeps next to them than they are about the producers. Why on earth would you punish them for getting \"creative\" when confronted with an elimination challenge? It creates drama, ergo content. The show is at risk of turning into a dollhouse for parasocial zoomers. It's not a soap opera, it's a competitive reality show where only one contestant is going to get to leave with the prize.",

People diagnosed with the disorder are said to be lively, dramatic, vivacious, enthusiastic, extraverted and flirtatious (all true).\n>People with HPD have a high desire for attention (always going where the action is, most pandering to the crowd, scheming with everyone against everyone), make loud and inappropriate appearances (piss warlock, scat scouting, enjoying the revenge porn attention), exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation. They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior (dressing like a slut, going \nafter Jon), express strong emotions with an impressionistic style (schizo ramblings), and can be easily influenced by others (radfem who panders to the /pol/ crowd because of her exes). Associated features include egocentrism (teehee), self-indulgence (teehee), continuous longing for appreciation (teehee), and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own wants (teehee).\n>>183929618\nRetarded principles are still principles and going back on them for money is weakness.",

I hope we can all agree Ben's just making these stories up at best to probe them and at worst to bother them and waste their time. So when I criticize Jon's overreaction to this one I say it from an understanding that nobody could possibly believe what Ben was saying is earnest. We all saw how Jon did react to it so he was either being real or fake. If he was real he has the IQ of a potato and nothing he does can be evaluated outside of an asylum and if he was fake he's not the genuine cherub everyone here wants him to be now because he was just forcing everyone into his reality which is something we've seen before.",

They're mostly bored and starved for attention so they're pretty receptive to flirting. Don't be too obvious, just do it to get some human interaction and then leave. Caf\u00e9s/restaurants can also be good at slow times. I recently had an interaction with a waitress and managed to talk her her into using her staff discount on my bill. She was flirting back pretty heavy and I probably could have got a date at least, but I'm already in a relationship.",

He's just playing them because he wants to be in control, especially since every time he's put on that act it's worked. They shut down the cameras after he went to the bathroom to cry about Simmons (who he has been completely turned against now just from catty gossip) and they gave him a pizza party. He completely overloaded on that and again they placated him to keep him from quitting. Then according to him hours ago they wanted to kick him out for that night, but he got his way and stayed.

I'm personally opposed bc i believe in that stuff but the entertainment value of it makes me kind of wish that theyd do it",

Then by logical reasoning they try to understand others.

As for Vance, he saw all the gestures behind his back and his lies were retarded enough even for Jon to pick upon (like his \"full name\" for example).
