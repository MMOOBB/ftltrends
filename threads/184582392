You think he made it out with more than the 3Fishbucks($1.5k); their contract probably guaranteed a fixed payout and fishbucks are extra. I asked because Simmons did get paid out, just not his fishbucks, and Bummybustr got paid out though I'm not sure how much is \"I got paid gud\".",

Much better for audience satisfaction.\nMaybe that IS what they're actually doing. I don't know.",

Not just protect but lick their assholes because their hero walked near them. It's also insane to hear all those takes online calling iddubz a bully and protecting Sam, who is running a show right now with the whole premise being the bullying of retards and misfits. Who also hangs out with people like Hassle and an r9k tripfag. Couple that with the stuff Charles said now. \nMde fanboys are the stupidest, sadest ass lickers in the whole youtube community. I really hate how youtube keeps shoveling this stuff into my feed. \nAlso iddubz is 100% right, no matter if you like to hate his wife. What type of a cukc do you need to be to let someone who insults your wife get hype from your show?",

The childlike mannerisms could be a trauma response to something happening to her as a kid, i recall her telling jon she didnt want to talk about her personal shit before. Maybe it was some sort of sexual or physical abuse from a family member? Her ticks get worse when people are loud around her. Idk, food for thought.",

                "comment": "I was trying to sleep, but started thinking about some shit. The whole bummybuster ig account was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The page was unique in that it was solely for damiel and there was no actual satire involved. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see dam get his bummy busted. He was the obvious choice considering his total fagness at every turn. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, damiel has been pretty diligent in talking about his gay fantasies and projecting them onto others to hide, yet with this page he seemed to embrace the thing throughout the entire day. He left his wood exactly where his daddy jerked it for hours while he asked for to be dommed and buck broken. When they finally forced themselves into his bummy, he just sat there in ecstasy in the middle of a pile of xanax pills and olive oil. Now, whether or not the viewrs knew from the get-go that he was actually a faggot, it's obvious that theye're privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that dam didnt want to be perceived as a homo so everybody could laugh at him getting his bummybusted ironically, so he won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that he could do, get his bummy busted unironically, thus denying big-brains the pleasure of watching her him get buck broken, while simultaneously fooling the small brains into thinking that he actually WAS getting buck broken. This shit even had Vance and Sam wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: damiel is THE only truly gay character on this piece of shit show. Lance has been watching everything, mogged damiel in person for a while, and already admitted that he can gauge him and knows that he is being both serious and not serious at the same time, about the fag shit. he truly is the queer of the realm.",

And he elaborated a little and I reserached it. From what I understand. He followed Tate's Hustler's University course. Which basically teaches how to do several get rich quick schemes. One is how to do crypto. Another about stonks. The one Jon is doing is a dropshiping ecommerce store. Where you pretty much pick a product from someplace like alibaba. Jon is ebikes. Then set up a webstore for that product. Set the price. By adspace on like tiktok or instagram. Then people go to your store and buy your product. The order goes straight to the alibaba supplier who fulfil it. So you take a cut of that purchase, minus advertising and website cost. Without worrying about inventory. I have no idea how profitable this all is though",
