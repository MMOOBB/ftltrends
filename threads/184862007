Rocky from the 12th onward, it fucking fell off a cliff yesterday. Not sure if it's just waning interest in general or a lack of shit happening, but /ftl/ now (probably) makes up roughly 10,000 posts a day, compared to 20,000 in our last check in and a total peak of around 40,000 - right after the fall of Simmons. \nIt's either just a slow week or the beginning of the end.

I've tried... 7 different ones now and none of them have actually been good.\nAll of them are essentially just a hinge you have to move by doing a pelvis thrust. The electronic ones have shit like hydraulics to make the movement more smooth, or even to control exactly when the knee bends, but at the end of the day they are all just hinges.\nI've seen prosthetic hands where people could move each finger individually. There is nothing even remotely close to that level of complexity for legs and probably wont be for decades.",

One mapped to sheep_xing and the ither one that was posted to /soc/.\nImagine trying to act like a lonely autistic outsider while you have two discords full of simps that you've used to hone your e-thot persona. \nShe is actually a bigger sociopath than Letty, who ironically (like Jon) might be too autistic to hide her femoid instincts behind a fraudulent uwu persona. She is the kind of girl who goes on r9k to complain about how lonely she is and then will sit on soc all day spawning new simps that sends her free things and cash. Like, look at her apartment and clothes and shit; she was obviously super poor as a kid but as an adult she's got a dope place to live and cutsey outfits and shit and she did not get those working as a fast food worker. That's all from a steady flow of simp bucks 100%.",

The leg does not move on it's own and the microchip basically has a bunch of sensors attached to it that tell the leg when it thinks is best to either lock into place or when to allow it to bend.\n\nThat is it. $80,000 for a microchip that tells the knee whether it should bend or not. I have absolutely no control over any of the joints in the leg though and if I want to move them I have to do other movements to get the leg to do what it wants.\nI for example can never use my prosthetic leg to initiate walking up a step. It simply cannot do this. Instead I have to use my sound leg to go up a step, then pull the prosthetic leg up afterwards.\n\n>>184862968\n\nRealistically, stuff like neuralink wont be available for decades now. If it was available and let me control a prosthetic leg, then yeah I'd get it. But I will be an old man long before that becomes a possibility.",

Almost all of the problems the UK faces can be either directly, or indirectly traces back to immigration.\nHell, I lost my leg largely due to immigration. A mixture of the NHS being overburdened by millions of illegal immigrants and hiring cheap, low skilled doctors from other countries to try and make up for the fact that there just isn't enough native British doctors to treat the sheer number of people living in the UK now.\nWithout mass immigration I might still have my leg (the first white British doctor I saw immediately recognized I had a serious problem and all the previous doctors had majorly fucked up my treatment).",

There seems to be a significant amount of separation between both of her reddit accounts, and the creation date of the Discord ID linked to the one I have (where everything was very purposefully scrubbed (including things posted a few weeks before Fishtank, might I add) is greater than the time she was posting her # on /u/Sheep_Xing. That's the one that was posted to /soc/, meaning, within reason, she has two.\n\nMy guess here is that she is actually into some rather freaky shit sexually, and tries to maintain a significant amount of separation between her two personas, or keep at the very least, keep it very well hidden. Unfortunately, her zoomer brain prevents her from good OpSec and adding a pretty obvious fucking keyword in her username is a terrible idea.",

                "comment": ">>184863618\nJosie is an ABDL furfag and a Bronie that cuts herself.\n\nParaphilic infantilism, also known as autonepiophilia and adult baby, is a sexual fetish that involves role-playing a regression to an infant-like state. Paraphilic infantilism is a form of ageplay. People who practice paraphilic infantilism are often colloquially referred to (by themselves and others) as \"adult babies\", or \"ABs\".\n\nBehaviors may include things such as wearing childish clothes, wearing or using diapers, cuddling with stuffed animals, drinking from a bottle or sucking on a pacifier, and (when done with others) engaging in gentle and nurturing experiences, baby talk, or BDSM power dynamics involving masochism, coercion, punishment or humiliation.\n\nParaphilic infantilism is often associated with diaper fetishism, a separate but related kink in which people derive sexual pleasure from themselves or others wearing or using diapers, without necessarily involving any form of ageplay. People with a diaper fetish are often informally called \"diaper lovers\", or \"DLs\". In practice, these strict labels do not always reflect the true diversity of sexual expression. As such, when considered together, paraphilic infantilism and diaper fetishism form a spectrum of behaviors that are often colloquially referred to under the umbrella term \"adult baby/diaper lover\", or \"AB/DL\" (also spelled \"ABDL\").",

Unfortunately, her zoomer brain prevents her from good OpSec and adding a pretty obvious fucking keyword in her username is a terrible idea.\nIt's been confirmed that she irl gore and self-harm to simps on alt Twitter account. So yeah, pretty freaky stuff indeed. \n>I should add to this, I'm pretty she still lives at home, but she did mention the other day she has fumos which cost a thousand+ dollars, which could very, very easily indicate some form of simp bux. \nThere's actually a video of her unboxing a Fumo. \nHer speech is completely different. \nHer persona entirely different.\nShe acts like your standard e-thot simp bucks enjoyer...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/bjeWPXy80Jk",

                "comment": ">>184864330\nI was trying to sleep, but started thinking about some shit. The whole bummybuster ig account was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The page was unique in that it was solely for damiel and there was no actual satire involved. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see dam get his bummy busted. He was the obvious choice considering his total fagness at every turn. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, damiel has been pretty diligent in talking about his gay fantasies and projecting them onto others to hide, yet with this page he seemed to embrace the thing throughout the entire day. He left his wood exactly where his daddy jerked it for hours while he asked for to be dommed and buck broken. When they finally forced themselves into his bummy, he just sat there in ecstasy in the middle of a pile of xanax pills and olive oil. Now, whether or not the viewrs knew from the get-go that he was actually a faggot, it's obvious that theye're privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that dam didnt want to be perceived as a homo so everybody could laugh at him getting his bummybusted ironically, so he won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that he could do, get his bummy busted unironically, thus denying big-brains the pleasure of watching her him get buck broken, while simultaneously fooling the small brains into thinking that he actually WAS getting buck broken. This shit even had Vance and Sam wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: damiel is THE only truly gay character on this piece of shit show. Lance has been watching everything, mogged damiel in person for a while, and already admitted that he can gauge him and knows that he is being both serious and not serious at the same time, about the fag shit. he truly is the queer of the realm.",

You guys melting down because you found out more about your super innocent waifu is hilarious but also kind of sad. Go outside brothers\nYou shouldn't be surprised. Josie simps are the same type of mentally ill losers who will throw cash on hot tubs girls on Twitch. The only thing greater than their mental illness and willingness to throw their NEET bucks on soulless thots, is the amount of copium they're willing to inject in their blood stream when their queen is threatened. Remember, there was a story of one of these crazy fuckers who literally killed his family when they tried to sever his ties to his e-thot. They are not being ironic, they're actually this insane. You'd have to be to throw $500 dog toys on some wigger junkie under the delusion that she's a virgin home maker.",
