You guys did a terrible job by releasing the other contestants info early, purposely adding friends and friends of friends to the show as contestants, improperly coding the website to the point 50k viewers cost you 30k a day, not monitoring their phone usage and only allowing them to call an emergency number during the swatting, and not having a solid plan of daily activities with actual time frames so the viewers know when to tune in, you try to blame Jon for ruining the show for being a \u2018narc\u2019. It\u2019s lame and he didn\u2019t ruin it, you guys did. Next time get actual randoms to join the game, have a solid grasp of what you\u2019re planning to do when they get there, and live up to what you tell the audience. You said no weed, no phones, unscripted. They\u2019ve smoked weed used their phones and most of the contestants are friends, friends of friends, or orbiters.",

His witty remarks gaslighting Jon were entertaining to the Jon haters, while causing no significant mental damage to Jon who had already suffered enough at the hands of Damiel. The exercise itself is of longterm benefit to Jon who got good workout advice and an ego boost to push harder to work out, and probably some confidence to BTFO Damiel verbally.\n\nSmashing the entire cabinet and fridge was classic absurdity. It fell a little flatter than usual only because many of the fish we suspect are Knowers, and only pretend to not know sam and his comedy. Otherwise that would have looked insane and probably scared them more than usual.\n\nThe crew will need to find new ways to pit the fish at each other. Right now we only have a mild Jon vs Vance.",
