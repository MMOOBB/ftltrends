                "comment": "Vance and Josie may be the most quiet but that's because they both have understood from the start what this all is, which is a game they've been playing. They both try in challenges, larp full on for challenges, and do their best to be likeable. \n\nLetty's unironic breakdowns, lawsuit threats, and running to producers means she just hasn't handled it as well. Even when Josie did have her singular breakdown she never ran to the producers, she just went to Vance and then her room alone to let it all out, and was laughing at a shark attack an hour later. Vance hasn't had a single breakdown, and despite everyone saying he's boring has had many good bits i.e. Lance and Vance, terrorizing fatty for being an annoying faggot, his skits, schizo larp, keep in mind he was the only fish to befriend his clone too which speaks to something affable and likeable about him. He also is constantly gaming everyone since the beginning, poorly maybe, but at least he's trying. Josie conversely has been extremely sincere and loved almost every bit the entire way through, and just been a genuine sweetheart, including having a bond with Vance. Them 1v1ing would be much more entertaining than just Vance or Josie versus the bitch no one likes who is just a bitch to everyone, does nothing, and takes no accountability. She's produced some content, sure, but she's become the \"main character\" solely out of having constant breakdowns and doing constant manipulation and then never following through, just letting other people do stuff for her. i.e. Mauro vs Vance, Chris vs Mauro, Damiel vs her which wasn't even incited by her lmao, Betty vs her where she unequivocally lost and cried lawsuit to make it stop, etc. \n\nIf it's really about who has survived \"Hellhouse\" the most unscathed, Vance and Josie have rolled with nearly every single bit. Letty is there by the skin of her teeth.",

Never makes a tangible point. Is ambiguous so you can fill in the gaps and and glom onto him with your personal beliefs.\nI think Twitch broke him. The ToS is so severe he had to tone down his dialect and be so ambiguous they could never find a reason to ban him.\nIf you do that 5+ hours a day for seven years, you start to lose touch with the rhythm of language and how to communicate normally.\nDude is fried and I take no pleasure in saying that.",

The people that actually like her are too few to make a career as a streamer(she currently thinks she has 40k followers). So there's a good chance she gets bullied off the show, makes no money, and realizes she has been humiliated to an entire online community. Anyway, I hope she takes it as well as she's taken some of the other shit so far. She doesn't deserve all the hate.",

If I'm being inaccurate please point out where I am. To refute your points, Letty ran to the producers after a fight with Sylvia early on, and later on when Sylvia bopped her with a vape. She also ran to the producers after Frank wrangled her around with her necklace/going for her necklace, and can't count the amount of times she's cried and broken down. \n\nI'm simply trying to point out that if the point is to reward the person least broken by Hellhouse, it's certainly not Letty. If it's the person who stirred up the most drama in Hellhouse, than it's Letty by a massive country mile.",

No one is gonna question why she says shit like \"Chris Chan's mom had it coming\" when its drowned out by 6 other people acting just as crazy.

Chris didn't have it in him to seal the deal though, even though he wanted to. \nHe freaked out at first when she said she noticed he had poop smears on his shorts and his ass. \nThey had to talk him out of the bathroom, which took a while.

At the same time, it's hard to count how many times Josie has had sharks dump shit on her and she just laughs along with it, showers, and cleans. That, getting her plushies fucked with, her bed and room fucked with happen daily, and she just cleans it up. Letty never cleans up her room, got Maruo to do it when he was there but that's about it. I won't disagree she creates a lot of \"content\", but she's been the least resilient to a lot of things. She even had to lock herself in Josie's room and talk to the producers when Chris was coming onto her, whereas this afternoon Chris was coming onto Josie aggressively and she just shut it down telling him how disrespectful he is. \n\nI'm not trying to be biased but again I think if it's about showing the most resilience, it's Josie > Letty. Vance obviously has shown the least since no one has cared enough to give him a shark attack or fuck with him in any way.",

One or two TTS got through calling her Nina early on I think. Every time it's been mentioned, it was always Letty herself bringing it up, anyways. If we're going to talk about pasts, how many times has Vance had his gf brought up, his skits, his username, same with Josie, her being trans, cutting her tits off, zippertits, guro, etc. They all just laugh that shit off. Even Vance did a whole NOOOOOO joke about his gf leaving him for BBC. Letty has been the most coddled in that sense. Rightfully so since there's actual legal action pending there (You can't legally have it depicted as \"nudes\", it always must be referenced as \"revenge porn\" because otherwise it can misconstrue it and be considered defamation since it implies she meant to have it out there and it wasn't private).",

She has no loyalty, principles, or identity, she's an empty-headed groupie cunt who'll gleefully laugh along with the rest of the herd as they bully somebody, and many examples can be seen of this throughout the show. She also pretends to stim because she knows it'll get her orbiters who'll give her the attention she's always desired. She enjoys being coddled and seen as unique. People like Josie will never be your friend. They're treacherous snakes and have no integrity. She's scum. But the simps will still call every critic a pajeet, and they'll keep calling her quirky and cute.",

Get over it.\n\nThe initial criteria is so stupid.\n>the one who did the best is the one who was the biggest \"sweetheart\" and \"handled hellohouse\" the best.\nYou leave no room for bias when it is objectively biased. You assume it's reactions to the same situation. No, Josie's fishtoy is positive. Letty's fishtoy is negative. That's one example of the mountain of bias we keep explaining to you. Letty is in hell. Letty's been weird in the past few days but Letty deserves to win if she finishes with the handicap.",
