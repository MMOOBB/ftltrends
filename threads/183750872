Being in this den of vipers is not good for him and it's clear the producers don't care THAT much about him, I mean christ look at the state he is in.",

Jon was getting some negative ones but so was everyone.\n\nAbout 30 min in, the shark that was moderating switched off and it became blatantly obvious a different shark was in control. This one basically only let anti-Jon and anti-Simmons TTS through to a ridiculous degree. It was complete manipulation of the TTS system specifically designed to buckbreak Jon & Simmons. Letty basically never got another negative TTS again. This was total bullshit and Jon deserves his TTS immunity after getting it worse than anyone else for a day straight due to TTS moderator bias.",

Then instead of laying low and waiting for this to blow over (which it would have pretty quickly, this is a niche streaming show that not that many people are following anyway), he gets on a Discord Q&A with fucking Frank Hassle and admits how his book could be easily misinterpreted, says the friend he showed the book to told him it was a bad idea to publish it, and confirms the restraining order against him is real.\nThe dumb fuck could not have possibly made himself look worse.",

It's entirely actual autistic people that are seething at her being autistic because she's also popular. They've turned their autism diagnosis into their entire personality and use it as a crutch to explain why they're so unlikeable and reviled. When they see a fellow autist doing well socially it sends them into a panic attack. They start to realize that their autism might not be the reason why everyone finds them insufferable. They have to terminate this thought immediately because it might actually lead to a modicum of self-reflection. So the only appropriate response is that Josie CAN'T be autistic, she MUST be faking.\n\nSo these posters comb over every second of Josie footage with a fine tooth comb looking for any moment where she stops stimming for a second or does something slightly neurotypical. Then they spam that shit incessantly going:\n\n>SEE! SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY AUTISTIC! SHE'S A FAKE!\n\nThe dead giveaway is that in the examples these autists use she is always still being completely autistic and weird to any normal person. That's the sign that you just know these autism truthers are extreme autismos themselves.",
