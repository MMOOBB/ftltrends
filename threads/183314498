Most people know that time is finite and if you are in your mid 20s and have no real income/portfolio you are kinda fucked.\nHell, what do you think it's better in a long run ? A niche game that can bring you a lot of trouble in the future, or a game that has potential to lowkey redpill people, make money and build for portfolio/exposure ?\nLike with AS and MDE, they said to him to close the fucking reddit and tone down a little (I know they were paying them shit).\nToday we might have how many seasons of a well produced MDE WP ? Hell, even with the exposure they would have gotten by it they could have gone of the leash and make their own WP uncensored and just make everything bigger.",

In the early seasons it was pretty interesting and the focus was on the psychological aspect of strangers surviving together. They even had to look after their own livestock in the British version. Another thing Big Brother did well is that the houses were designed so that there was nowhere for the contestants to escape to, every room had cameras, including the toilets, which kept the psychological pressure on the contestants.",

You can put multiple streams into the feed of a larger stream. Example, you can have a webcam stream, and a game stream, and a transparent layer with a speedrun timer, audio device1, audio device2. Look how fast you could click different cameras on fishtank website and instantly have video and audio with no buffering. Each user was probably getting the data for all 10 cameras and audio, and the front end just mutes or puts on the front layer the one you select. In addition theres data analytics / metadata associated with username, login, etc which get sent back to their cloud hosting. So in total, an exponential growth of bandwidth use as new viewers watch, which drove up their costs for their data plan pricing.",

Capitalism implies competition, he (rather, the people controlling him) actively seek to stifle competition and new start-ups, which is antithetical to capitalism. The result is the abolishment of capitalism which we see openly promoted by the WEF. I already addressed this toddler-tier argument, were you just too stupid to get it or did you not even notice? haha",

Let's just take a moment to gently correct your simplistic understanding, shall we? You see, dear, capitalism is a broad economic system with various manifestations. The fact that some capitalists may act anti-competitively doesn't automatically negate the entire premise of capitalism. Instead, it merely highlights the greed and self-interest that can sometimes arise within this system. But worry not, precious. I'm sure you'll grasp these complex ideas eventually. Keep trying, and maybe one day you'll be able to contribute meaningfully to a grown-up discussion. Until then, isn't it past your bedtime?",

Let me break it down for you, as if you were a small, confused child. You see, my point was never to refute your argument entirely, but rather to illustrate the complexity of the subject. Capitalism is a nuanced system, and by boiling it down to a few misguided points, you're oversimplifying the matter. It's clear that you're eager to paint with broad strokes, but that's just not how the world works, sweetheart. And as for your claims about me being a \"marxist halfwit,\" it's simply adorable that you think tossing around labels will somehow win you an intellectual victory. It's clear that you're grasping at straws, and I must say, it's quite endearing.\n\nNow, why don't you take a step back, take a deep breath, and try to formulate a well-reasoned argument? I know it might be difficult for you, but I have faith that one day you'll manage to participate in a meaningful dialogue. Until then, keep working on your critical thinking skills, and who knows?
