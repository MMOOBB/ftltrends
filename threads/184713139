You'd have to swap out the batteries a couple times a day, they couldn't be shirtless without having a mic taped to them, they would have to be constantly monitored 24/7 if they broke them or turned them off\n the only benefit would be that you could have all the audio isolated and clean to edit later like TV reality shows here. I agree they need better sound though. They just need more mics in the big rooms like living room, kitchen and they need to put up foam or something in the garage to kill the reverberation.",

It's much more sterilized in terms of what happens physically to the contestants. Mic packs are more likely to be ruined in fishtank. There are too many points of failure added with this solution. \n\nBig brother also uses multiple other mics, is highly edited, and is not live.",
