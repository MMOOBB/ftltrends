Obviously you can't say everything and there will always be limits, like you can't have someone over TTS give instructions on how to make bombs or start calling in bomb threats. The autistic freaks who obsess over idiotic concepts like absolutism need to kill themselves. Sam is right about that.\nThe problem is that the stream goes beyond that and has a problem with TTS mentioning someone like Nick Fuentes who Sam Hyde is friends with, calling people fat when they are fat. Now we are approaching idubbbz level of cuck.\nIf they wanted to not be too mean on day 2 they should have made it clear. I am sure Sam spoke about it on some livestream somewhere but I didn't see that shit and I am not going to hunt for clips.

All of the shit that you newfags are reeing about in this thread was disclaimed previously. \nJet very clearly said in a recent prior stream that his biggest fear is someone quitting in the first week/few days, so he'd be easing the fish into the torture and TTS rather than bombarding them right away.\nThey very clearly stated that they can't get away with true free speech because of payment processors.\n>>183256064\nNiggers like this are a prime example of why we can't have nice things. Even with heavy moderation, all it takes is one fuckwit attempting to get them shut down through the payment processor with clips. \n\nAn extraneous example is TheRightStuff, a right-wing podcast site that went through every single payment processor in existence, each one being bombarded with clips of thing they had said by various agencies and activists until their only option was a russian processor that has an enormous profit take, and even then, that processor shut them down, to a point where the only funding they can recieve is via money order/ mailed cash/ crypto. \n\nThis is the exact reason why you can't scream 1488 GAS THE KIKES on tts. It's out of their hands. \nIf you can't comprehend that, you're a fucking retard.",
