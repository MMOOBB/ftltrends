They only somewhat stopped the practice after it was scientifically proven to result in deformities. \nThey then created a hilarious rule that so long as anyone is born of a jewish woman, that they're a jew, regardless of the fathers race. \nThey had to do this because they fucked their own genepool so badly, that they had to syphon off of other races. \nWhat are known as jews today, are all really just race-mixed mongrels of one type or another. \nFunnily enough, though jews claim that whites are a social construct, it's actually really jews that are a social construct. They don't really exist as an authentic ethnic group, and they haven't, for a very long time.",

If you NEED friends I've met plenty of like minded people over MP games, I say some stupid jokes and it tickles their pickle, then they tickle my pickle and the next thing you know we're buddies. It just happens. If you just want friends for the sake of having friends then you're missing the point. also stop watching this slop 99% of it is nothing even with the Jon kino. and if you donated any money slap yourself and give equal amounts of that some legit charity as penitence. Also I hope you're drunk, stop crying online you forced me to write a faggy blog out of pity fuck you nigger",

It made it clear that not enough planning and thought went into the show, and that the \"game\" aspect of it was even more of farce than what everyone was expecting. So it went from being a fun game show with hijinks to an anarchy torture session basically overnight. Mauro sensed this immediately, that's why he left. The others were spooked as well. Jon even got grossly ill. The \"show\" - at least how it was first pitched to the contestants - was effectively KILLED. We are watching Fish Tank's corpse. What will follow I am not sure, but shit's noticeably getting weirder.\n\nAlso the house is defo already haunted and people really shouldn't be trying to manifest an entity because that's a surefire way to get one (and not just somebody in a costume).",
