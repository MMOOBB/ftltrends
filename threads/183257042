Honestly, speak genuinely, why are you all so against slow burn psychological torture? You just want off the walls cursing and strobe lights. Why can't you vibe into that? Why can't you understand they are roping it in by boiling the frog and playing good cop bad cop on purpose. Why can't you understand that payment processors won't allow you to say 1488 hail hitler cp is based and stay on the air? Why do you want to swat them and get someone injured/killed and have Sam get arrested for negligence and get a million dollars in legal fees?\nt. someone who has spent $0 and will spend $0 on this.",

I don't paypig or follow his stupid boxing shit or whatever so I'm not aware of what he's up to now, but right now this is becoming increasing lackluster and more of a meet-and-greet with Jet than a MDE take on Big Brother. I don't care about spamming nigger in TTS or any of that, I just want structured exciting content that forces the contestants to be incredibly awkward around each other or actually going about the day with a goal in mind. Big Brother works because jealousy and power dynamics are established from the start. The Big Bed should've been a reward for winning a challenge. There should've been a couple extra contestants too so that alliances can form. Really Jet having to BEG the fish to play card games, tell stories, or drink the haha fake beer 5x each was a major red flag",
