The dude responsible should get fired ASAP.\nAlso the content is so fucking boring right now at the beginning of the event when they are supposed to get the most viewers. They should start doing challenges right this very moment or they will keep bleeding viewers like crazy.\nThe boiling a frog thing is not working and the audience is getting bored and leaving.\nThis is the first saturday of the event, most people work during the week and then they can tune in on their free time (weekend) but the retard Jet has decided that this weekend they should just rest and that they will continue the event on monday when people have work again.\nIt's astonishing how much they are fucking this up, Sam should just fire Jet and start doing challenges right now.",

On real shows there\u2019s a team of people sifting through thousands to try and find the strongest personalities. Then with a little bit of encouragement from the production staff they can create some interesting interactions. Add on top of that real activities that force people into competitive or cooperative situations and you\u2019ve got the possibility for explosive confrontations or endearing friendships.\n\nEven that show, done perfectly, is a complete waste of time. The only thing this show could have done to beat it would be to lean into the edginess and grassroots meme culture to try and transcend reality tv.

The only hope we have is for later weeks to actually be challenging for the fish and weed out this very sad attatchment to e-girls.

Every hour of fishtank would be a 2 part Dvd to have footage of all 10 cameras. \n\nCan't make a \"forever\" streaming service for it either, because streaming video costs money. \nDownload it? will be over a terabyte of data. Data that has to be hosted and transferred to people. Also costs a fuckload of money. \nThe price for Jet to send you a copy of the footage is more than the $40 you paid him to chat on fishtank by a lot.
