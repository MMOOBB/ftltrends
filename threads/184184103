The old lady ended up getting her $20 back and we were let go, but I'm the worst for betraying my brother like that. I've changed since then and I will never betray anyone like that.

Continued to drink til I was wasted every night for maybe 2 years or so. Got a DUI, went to jail for three days (not blaming my dad for that, it was a very stupid decision to drive drunk). I have not drank since, or talked to me dad. This all happened 12-13 years ago. \n\nToday I have a wife, my first son on the way, a house, and a great job. Could have turned out way worse.

It was funny because the cops literally were like \u201cwoah that\u2019s pretty harsh don\u2019t say that to people\u201d and let her be.
