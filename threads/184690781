None of them. The numbers are very clearly faked in some fashion. There are not going to be literally thousands of people tuning in just to watch people snore.\n\nThis guy is probably right: >>184693109\nin that it has like a 3.5k floor, so the number of actual people watching right now would be closer to 1.5k.

I think the chargeback bullshit mind broke him when he learned his simp paypigs were scamming him.",

Look at how happy she gets when they scream at her vs how much she seethed in previous days watching Josie drown in plushies. Literally the best way to crush her would be to ignore her and give attention to the other contestants especially the girls, or to send Jet up out of character and just say \u201cdo something, because you\u2019re not very interesting\u201d and leave. It would instantly break her but instead these socially inept zoomers and paypig voyeurs are fueling her ego giving her attention and paying money to scream at her which just turns her on.\nIf they really want her off the show just shut her down attention wise and she\u2019ll run out of dopamine and quit.\nOther girls weaknesses:\n>Sylvia \nHonest criticism makes her break down and cry, and any form of work or exercise makes her want to give up\n>Josie\nLoud noises and lack of physical security. If they took her door off the hinges, ripped up her plushies and screamed at her a few times a day she would give up",

The sharks keep dumping trash and making her clean it up, as well as cook for them on demand. The other fish have tried a few things to get in her head and it all fails.\nAnything that happens she either laughs it off or doesn't care.\nJust because their tactics aren't working doesn't mean they haven't tried.\n\n>having a job is not maturity\nI'd say sitting at home all day smoking weed and playing video games is a sign of immaturity. Same with whoring out. etc.\nThe comparison is with the other fish.\n>besides its just a an entry level job that you can do as a teen even.\nSame as above. A job is better than no job.\n\n>damiel was a linecook and look at that guy, well into his 30's but immature as fuck.\nTrue and a fair point but this isn't solely about age.
