They're gonna ramp this shit up heavy, Jet told them no more sleeping til 3PM, they're getting woken up at 11 AM today for god knows what. Sam said they could be bringing in wild animals or something crazy, but it seems like every passing week is just going to get more and more relentlessly chaotic. The sharks are starting to come in and fuck shit up right in the contestants faces. It's only gonna get worse.\n\nThe reason they pull back occassionally on the torture is because they don't just want everyone leaving immediately.

Really sad, since rules and structure are why these shows are interesting.\n>what does being two-faced/plotting ACTUALLY do?\nIt does do something.\nFirst, you can coordinate Fishbuck rewards since those are based on challenges, so you get to make a little bit of money.\nSecond, you can share information or gossip about people to strategically isolate them or create situations that ruin their reputation with fans. Since the eliminations will be based entirely on who brings in more money, this does have an indirect effect, not that the Fish realize it.\nThird, it creates situations in which you can have clusters of interacting fish to generate \"content\" and thus become more interesting to fans watching, sans josiecels who don't care about content.",

Throwing her stuff out is a really niggerish way to do it. Pack it or bunch it up, hand it to her and tell her to get lost, that'd be perfectly reasonable, just as entertaining and you could get an unjustified but entertaining reaction from her.\nThrowing her shit out and breaking it just makes her more of an underdog and leaves nothing to discuss or enjoy about the situation. It's just a weak fligger bullying a girl cause he can't bully Jon anymore.",
