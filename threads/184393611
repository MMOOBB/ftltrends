Damiel was saying shit like he would strangle her if she wasn't a girl. Damiel eventually goes into Letty's room and takes all her shit and dumps it in the port-a-potty.\n\nJet sits them all down and Damiel tries to justify his actions with retard logic even after finding out letty wasn't involved. Dodges questions about how he wouldn't talk shit to lance when he found out it was actually him who took the shoes. Starts talking shit about Letty being abused in past relationships. Just ended up going too far, and Letty was worried for her safety.\n\nSharks pull Damiel into basement for about 20min. He comes up and gives some non apology apology about how he had just found out his baby was born today and that he was just gonna go ahead and leave to bust some bummies.\n\nThis is a rushed kinda half assed explanation but there's a greentext explanation that covers it as well in one of the previous threads today. I'm sure someone will also drop a YT video on the whole situation if there's not one already.",
