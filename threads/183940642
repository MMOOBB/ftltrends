These archives are riddled with several issues. Before you go blaming your friendly pirate, you should know:\n\n- Fishtank.Live archives are motion activated. No, you don't actually get the uncut footage with a Season Pass.\n- Fishtank.Live archives consist of thousands of mkv files, most, if not all of which contain corrupt header data. Because of this, you will not be able to preview the duration of each file. You can use ffmpeg to resolve this.\n- Fishtank.Live archives were recorded without audio until Day 5. Some cameras seem to have audio enabled before Day 5, but you shouldn't be suprised if a clip your looking for lacks audio entirely.\n- Fishtank.Live archives are incomplete. Don't ask why. They just are. Some cameras just aren't recorded all of the time. Now pay $40!\n- Fishtank.Live archives are mislabeled. Don't blame your friendly pirate for the fact the directory names are wrong.\n- Fishtank.Live archives DO contain the embarassing footage of police raiding the house. I suggest taking a look at those particular clips.\n- Fishtank.Live archives contain a directory called \"the-quite-room\". This directory can only be seen when capturing via script. It's empty.\n- and finally, Fishtank.Live archives cost $40. That's right. $40 for corrupt, auto-generated motion captures from security camera software.\n\n\nIt's also to spite Sam and Jet because they are literally seething on Twitter about the missing shekels that should have been paypigged to papa Sam.\n\n \u2026\u2026..\u2026../\u00b4\u00af/) NUMDE (\\\u00af`\\\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026/\u2026.//\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \u2026\\\\\u2026.\\\n\u2026\u2026\u2026../\u2026.//\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2026.\\\\\u2026.\\\n\u2026../\u00b4\u00af/\u2026./\u00b4\u00af\\\u2026\u2026\u2026../\u00af `\\\u2026.\\\u00af`\\\n.././\u2026/\u2026./\u2026./.|_\u2026\u2026_| .\\\u2026.\\\u2026.\\\u2026\\.\\..\n(.(\u2026.(\u2026.(\u2026./.)..)..(..(. \\\u2026.)\u2026.)\u2026.)\u2026 )\n.\\\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\\/\u2026/\u2026.\\. ..\\/\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026./\n..\\\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. /\u2026\u2026..\\\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026/\n\u2026.\\\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026./",

If what you claimed was true, no one would be able to watch this show. All the cameras would not work, no one would hear or see anything. They are recording locally, they have all the footage stored, the archives are just a preview of the data that's available, they probably intended for it to be like a vod system but the developer just gave up. The broken headers are because you are seeing a preview of the larger files that re generated, that's why they are all mkv, transcoding 72 hours of garage footage is a huge waste of resources and bandwidth for the server. You are actually retarded and wasting your time. If you believe that they are not recording anything, keep on doing what you want, but you need to realize you are just wasting your time.",

He's been there for 3 months. Given that he's immediately cleared to take a month off to do Fishtank, he's likely there on a commission only basis. Once the show is over, he's probably going to lose that job, either through incompetence or trannies calling in after the show's completion.",

The points into money thing is great because it makes it harder for people to tell how much they're actually spending.
