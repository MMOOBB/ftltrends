I think everyone watching it just hates modern women and instead of trying to fix the problem or change them all the audience wants to do is make them suffer as standins for the women in their own lives. Cosmic justice vicarously through destroying the self esteem of these girls. It feels evil. Definitely not something good people do. Its just so lopsided and targeted, Josie and Vance get left alone. I fucking hate everyone who's jumping on the dogpile. Actual evil, satans work. I didn't believe incels were a real thing before watching this show for the last 3 weeks.",

He's no longer the happy go lucky guy he used to be years ago. Obviously he's grown and faced challenges, but why are we watching random people come into the tank that are obviously there for a freak show purpose, like this airsoftfatty guy, but then Sam wants to give him a self help lesson and make sure his life is ok?\n\nHe's using him as entertainment value for his monstrous appearance and weird behavior and then trying to help him? This is contradictory behavior. And then getting mad at Vance for checking in on him? Almost like Sam's anger at vance is a little bit of projection to assuage his guilt of using this guy as a freak show.\n\nIf you're going to do that in the first place, use him for his entertainment value, pay the man for his contribution and off camera help him find a place or insulin or whatever but why the performative scene on camera? Take him into the basement and talk about this\n\nI wanted a funny show where they fuck with the contestants who signed up for it in clever audience directed or challenge oriented ways. I think they should have kept all the fish and didn't do eliminations, just placement of who wins the most money at the end. I didn't want to see frank hassle piss on everything.\nThe Fish seem like an afterthought currently and the show seems like it had no real direction. They kicked people off but then had to bring in more people because the show was boring and nothing was interesting",

The narrator finds it strange how aggressive and unhappy Sam has become, considering his previously cheerful nature. They criticize Sam for exploiting contestants for their oddities, yet pretending to help them, leading to a contradictory and guilty behavior, which is projected onto Vance. The show lacks direction, with the fish and eliminations being overshadowed by the focus on sensationalism and lack of interesting content.",

Some of the earlier challenges were funny and interesting, especially with the group dynamics, would have been even better if they layered challenges AND the audience got to fuck with them in the middle of them. But back when they had more Fish and better challenges, Sam and Jet seemed like they were playing way too safe or they didn't full have things planned out. Like when they gave them handicaps and then Jet said \"just act retarded on top of that' and then ended it because it was just cringe and not funny. Make them handicapped but have them do another physical challenge, make teams, make them have to take care of their babies at the same time. But no just give them a \"handicap\" and watch them sit around and eat food....WOW!\n\n>FRANK MAKE DOODOO ON BED TEEHEE\n\nZZZZZZZZZ",
