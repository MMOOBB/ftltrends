People pointing out that Letty has been fucked with the most are missing the part where she brought a lot of it on herself. Being a manipulative, duplicitous contestant is a strategy for sure, but so is trying to genuinely get along with others and make friends.\n\nI'd probably respect Letty more if she had not gone on the show with an open court case, which has conveniently been used as a cudgel against producers and contestants alike.",
