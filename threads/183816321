Calling someone a pedo for nothing, especially in his position, is dangerous. \nThe experience also opened my eyes to Sam actually being closeted. \n\nBut to be honest, Sam hasn\u2019t been good for years and I\u2019ve just been using his platform to advertise my own shit to his fans (and it worked).",

This can include extreme repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel \"normal\" or \"accepted\". Other expressions of internalized homophobia can also be subtle. Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles.[14] Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT people who support \"compromise\" policies, such as those that find civil unions acceptable in place of same-sex marriage.[72]\n\n>Some studies have shown that people who are homophobic are more likely to have repressed homosexual desires.[73] In 1996, a controlled study of 64 heterosexual men (half said they were homophobic by experience, with self-reported orientation) at the University of Georgia found that men who were found to be homophobic (as measured by the Index of Homophobia)[73] were considerably more likely to experience more erectile responses when exposed to homoerotic images than non-homophobic men.[74]",

I would embark on a well-detailed monologue about the damage caused by circumcision to most American males, and how I miraculously escaped it with my penis intact. I would be sure to pepper in many details about how the head of my penis is smooth and shiny and pink. And how the foreskin acts as a sleeve during sex, which avoids the embarassing \"queefing\" that occurs during \"friction sex\" with the mutilated penis. I would continuously mention that my penis can become rock hard in almost an instant due to the billions of nerve endings in the foreskin and prepuce, which have not been damaged or removed. \nI would describe the sensation I feel around the corona of the glans, as I gently tug the foreskin up and down. It's heavenly. \nEventually they would be salivating and would have no choice but to ask for a demonstration. At this point, I am erect. And I happily oblige. \nJosie leaves the room well before this. And I split my fishbuchs (and my seed) with Letty and the Braphog (my new band name, btw)",

Between the cameras turning off a couple of nights ago and this morning is the least I've watched this since began airing. They really should have just kept TTS going non stop - even with fake TTS messages. The whole point of the room is to outlast people, but how difficult (or entertaining to watch) is that if you can sleep and rest in silence? I'm sure people have all kinds of other outlandish suggestions to make \"the cage\" more difficult, but honestly they were already doing the TTS for the first few hours. Why wouldn't they just do it constantly? Anyway, the only two real contestants who actually spoke up against how annoying Jon can be are both out, so the show has been meh since then.",

He's one of the few people who actually had the balls (ironically enough) to tell Jon off, he had a great dynamic with the girls, and he did the whole cross dressing bit. Like it or love it, but he created WAYYYY more content for the house than Vance, Slyvia, Maruo, Damiel, and Josie (people MAKE content of Josie - she rarely produces much of her own). So yeah, I think it sucks that he's gone because he added an interesting dynamic to the mix. But he was targeted and removed - I'm not saying what he wrote isn't creepy, but without hard facts it's just him being weird and creepy. Jon is weird and creepy. Most of these people are.",

But you can see that with everyone locked in the room, he doesn't produce much entertaining content on his own. He has to be around people. But the people he had some of the most interesting dynamics with are gone. People can say Vance and Slyvia are boring - but honestly, if I were in the house I would avoid Jon like a plague too. God forbid I ever got trapped in a room with him, like Simmons, and had to listen to the man basically have a mental breakdown because someone doesn't like Andrew Tate. Also, he was MORE hilarious when Sam and the audience were purposely fucking with him. No, he hasn't \"won me over\" because he's a narcissist who just talks about himself and throw literal tantrums when someone has an opinion about him or something he enjoys.",

Jet and the staff checked on him several times and Sam bought him special water.\n\nHe has been brought downstairs multiple times to \"cool off\", in addition to getting the same cool off periods as the rest of the contestants. He gets the food he asks for. He gets special water he asks for. He is practically never told no.\n\nYou are delusional, and probably have a similar IQ to Jon.",

He's been born into an impure world, residing in an impure vessel but he exhibits all the traits of someone divinely inspired. He stands up for the weak and protects the innocent. Every time he's shown on screen reading the bible it appears he cant get past the first few pages of genesis, and yet he exemplifies through his actions all the teachings of Christ.\n\nHe loves all the other fishes unconditionally and is constantly trying to befriend them. Even when they spur his advances or mock him he's always quick to forgive. He loves god with all his heart and has offered up his bible to the other fishes. No one else has offered to share any of their personal belongings period beyond Jon and his bible. He may be extremely gullible and easily manipulated but he also has an unwavering moral core and unshakeable faith in Christ that keeps him safe from harm.\n\nHe is the protagonist of the fish tank and he is going to win.",

That the staff felt sorry for him and babied him? Prior to that, the audience was more than happy to see Sam beat the fuck out of him on a nightly basis.
