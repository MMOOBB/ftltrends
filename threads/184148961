The challenges are probably going to get more weird and fucked up as the show goes on. We basically found Jon's limit, which was he was never going to do any challenges that were too overtly offensive. So he was never going to last till the end for an MDE style elimination reality TV show. \n\nIt sucks because he's way more entertaining than Vance but Vance did the challenge like his life depended on it and Jon spent a whole day blocking the producers from even being able to get into his room. I don't see any solution here that doesn't involve Jon leaving. It sucks because I don't think the elimination format is conductive to producing good content. Sam & Jet obviously know this now for S2, but it doesn't help much atm.",
