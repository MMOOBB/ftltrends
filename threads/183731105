The Jontent bros, the Maurobros, the Vancechads, the Damnationfags, the Josimps, the Letty Warriors, the Simmonsisters, the HogKings, the Jokerposters, the Jetposters, Jet samefagging occasionally running damage control - all of it. I really had a fun time. \nFigured I should get this out of the way now since the show is clearly over, with Mauro gone, Simmons evicted out of Sam's kneejerk reaction to twitterfags, Sylvia most likely gone too (she was packing up before the cam went down), Damiel and Vance confirmed as plants, and Jon indisposed, there's nobody left to pickup the pieces, and it'd take too long for them to find replacements for essentially 90% of the crew. \n\nRemember these moments if you can, don't let them get lost like tears in rain.",

Legally speaking they're more close to being in a psychotic state than a reasonable minded one, thus when (thats when) the inevitable lawsuit arrives, you better believe it won't be contestants being held accountable for the words they said on stream re: simmons. Why would it? It's going to be the crew, the fans who participated, and anyone else deemed of a sound mind that egged it all on\n\npeople can say they signed a contract, this is a reality show blah blah blah, but none of this has been done before and it's a legal grey area (not to mention an ethical one) that they are all wading into together. including you\n\nbeware, and consider dropping the tank for this reason",

And regrettably for the children, most likely\nsomeone less qualified.\u201d\n\u201cI hate this.\u201d Dr. Halsey got up and strode to the fire exit. \u201cAnd sometimes, D\u00e9j\u00e0, I hate you, too.\u201d She\nleft the observation room.\nMendez was waiting for her in the hallway.\n\u201cWalk with me, Chief,\u201d she said.\nHe followed without a word as they took the stairs to the pre-op wing of the hospital.\nThey entered room 117. John lay in bed and an IV drip was attached to his arm. His head had been\nshaved and incision vectors had been lasered onto his entire body. Despite these indignities, Dr. Halsey\nmarveled at what a spectacular physical specimen he had grown into. (.....)\nDr. Halsey forced the best smile she could muster. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, ma\u2019am,\u201d John replied groggily. \u201cThe nurse said the sedation would take effect soon. I\u2019m\nfighting it to see how long I can stay awake.\u201d His eyelids fluttered. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201d\nJohn spotted Mendez and he struggled to sit up and salute, but failed. \u201cI know this is one of the Chief\u2019s\nexercises. But I don\u2019t know what the twist is. Can you tell me, Dr. Halsey? Just this time? How do I\nwin?\u201d\nMendez looked away.\nDr. Halsey leaned closer to John as he closed his eyes and started to breathe deeply.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how to win, John,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou have to survive.\u201d",
