Josie went into detective mode figuring out who poured coffee on her bed (she can't smell so thought it was coffee). She ultimately determined it was Sylvia (rare Josie L) and with Vance's advice decided she needs to take action right away. She deduced a plan to do her makeup like Sylvia's (and looked like an angel in red lipstick) and to have the chat donate around her saying things like \"WOW NICE MAKEUP JOSIE YOU'RE THE BEST AND MAKEUP WHAT UNIQUE MAKEUP\". Before she could finish it Jet called for all the fish for their morning briefing causing Josie, with half done makeup, to utter \"fucking jet...\"\n\nHe told them it was the BE A NIGGER challenge and they would be divided into Bloods and Crips. They got their colours and had to defend their turf and press a G if they stepped up. People who say the nigger word get double points when used in they presses y heard. Josie got that dawg n her and took to dis shiet like some mufguin duck 2 koolaid no cap she runnin this block foreal. She stomped dat bitch letty and stole back her plsuhies after fatboy nigger tried to lock her in the bathroom 4 closet like a straight goof from Canada (iykyk).
