                "comment": "I was trying to sleep, but started thinking about some shit. The whole Sylvia was acting bit was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The situatiom was unique in that for the first time she was being called a hog by a real person and not a disembodied voice from the walls. There was a meter rising and the chat wanted to see Frank Hassle bully the fish. She was the obvious choice considering her obvious insecurity about her weight. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, she has has been pretty diligent in letting us know that she's only 160lbs and that she signed up for this, bros.. but this time she seemed to be all over the place. She left the bed exactly where Frank dropped it for hours while she flirted with him and tried to bribe him into bullying Letty. When he finally declined her she just sat there brewing in the sexual tension and tried to get the condom on Frank's schlong. Now, whether or not she was horny from the get-go, it's obvious that she was in heat. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that Sylvia perceived how the whole thing looked, and went apeshit on him as a cope for being negged so hard. She started screaming and yelling so she could later claim she was just acting to fuck with the fish. She won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that she could do, have a meltdown and pretend she was pretending. This shit even had Vance and Josie wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Sylvia is THE only truly piglike character on this piece of shit show. Chris has been watching everything, screamed at Sylvia in person for a while after she turned her tusks toward him, and already admitted that she has no respect for him and thinks that she is being both fat and rude at the same time. She truly is the hog of the realm.",

                "comment": ">>184596921\nI was trying to sleep, but started thinking about some shit. The whole bummybuster ig account was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The page was unique in that it was solely for damiel and there was no actual satire involved. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see dam get his bummy busted. He was the obvious choice considering his total fagness at every turn. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, damiel has been pretty diligent in talking about his gay fantasies and projecting them onto others to hide, yet with this page he seemed to embrace the thing throughout the entire day. He left his wood exactly where his daddy jerked it for hours while he asked for to be dommed and buck broken. When they finally forced themselves into his bummy, he just sat there in ecstasy in the middle of a pile of xanax pills and olive oil. Now, whether or not the viewrs knew from the get-go that he was actually a faggot, it's obvious that theye're privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that dam didnt want to be perceived as a homo so everybody could laugh at him getting his bummybusted ironically, so he won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that he could do, get his bummy busted unironically, thus denying big-brains the pleasure of watching her him get buck broken, while simultaneously fooling the small brains into thinking that he actually WAS getting buck broken. This shit even had Vance and Sam wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: damiel is THE only truly gay character on this piece of shit show. Lance has been watching everything, mogged damiel in person for a while, and already admitted that he can gauge him and knows that she is being both serious and not serious at the same time, about the fag shit. he truly is the queer of the realm.",
