Does being hated at middle of the week count as a loss? Is that what you're saying? Because if you're saying that I can assure you that you're wrong. Why would you make this topic when the fishtank is still on? Jon is still trying right now and he has been the best fish in the tank for how many weeks now? He's competing with the worst contestants in the show who just happen to have a lead because they're feeding off the energy of the disability challenge. But you know what? They still fucking suck. Jon is one of the best fucking fishes in the tank, he went ham last week and would of won the first week if Letty didn't choke the baby. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded posts like this. You know why? Because you're going to be embarrassed when Jon wins and someone bumps this thread. Oh look at that, Sylvia just went to her room and is just lying there, just like Mauro did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a post on this board again and I'm fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you're the only guy making all these anti-Jon posts because you're a faggot hater who doesn't like a fish because he's good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking faggots on the board, like I give a fuck. It's so easy to spot out your posts now, you're a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don't you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a post like this. That's just you, you're always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.",

                "comment": "These fucking retards should think out the challenges more and actually make it a competition.\nThe way they should be doing is judging every day who does the best and the worst act. If you successfully pretend to be disabled you get 1 point, you get 1 point extra if you go the extra mile and make it entertaining. Vance would get 2 points for both acting schizo and actually sticking to it and interacting with people as a schizo and generating content. Sylvia gets 1 point because she had her earphones on but no bonus points because she slept and interact with people very little. Jon gets -1 point for not pretending to be schizo.\nTell them the score every day so they can see if they have to take it seriously. If you are in last place you will go home, twitter doesn't decide it, if your score is the lowest you will get kicked out. If you are first, second or third place you know how many points you need to get those 3 fishbucks. If you're in the bottom 3 you know that if you fuck up the challenge you may go home.\nIf this is how it worked then Jon would see he is at the bottom and he needs to work extra tomorrow to not be in last place.\n\nBut that's not how it works. Instead they're told that they count every infraction. So what, every time Jon was on screen not acting schizo he just got a penalty point? If this is how it worked Jon right now has 1000 penalty points and Josie has 0. Josie would have to walk non-stop all day after getting the wheelchair disability for it to make sense to lose to Jon.\nBut disregard all that. There is no fucking way they are counting the infractions. This is just a popularity contest. They will kick out whoever they want, so why the fuck even have a challenge?",

It seems like the producers have a hard time getting out of their own way. Someone said it the contestants have way too much variety with people constantly coming into the house and it's be better if the only faces they saw were the sharks and goldstriker. They're probably right, though I also wish there was a penalty for going into the basement for a non-emergency.",
