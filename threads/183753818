It's entirely actual autistic people that are seething at her being autistic because she's also popular. They've turned their autism diagnosis into their entire personality and use it as a crutch to explain why they're so unlikeable and reviled. When they see a fellow autist doing well socially it sends them into a panic attack. They start to realize that their autism might not be the reason why everyone finds them insufferable. They have to terminate this thought immediately because it might actually lead to a modicum of self-reflection. So the only appropriate response is that Josie CAN'T be autistic, she MUST be faking.\n\nSo these posters comb over every second of Josie footage with a fine tooth comb looking for any moment where she stops stimming for a second or does something slightly neurotypical. Then they spam that shit incessantly going:\n\n>SEE! SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY AUTISTIC! SHE'S A FAKE!\n\nThe dead giveaway is that in the examples these autists use she is always still being completely autistic and weird to any normal person. That's the sign that you just know these autism truthers are extreme autismos themselves.",

Every time he's shown on screen reading the bible it appears he cant get past the first few pages of genesis, and yet he exemplifies through his actions all the teachings of Christ. \n\nHe loves all the other fishes unconditionally and is constantly trying to befriend them. Even when they spur his advances or mock him he's always quick to forgive. He loves god with all his heart and has offered up his bible to the other fishes. No one else has offered to share any of their personal belongings period beyond Jon and his bible. He may be extremely gullible and easily manipulated but he also has an unwavering moral core and unshakeable faith in Christ that keeps him safe from harm.\n\nHe is the protagonist of the fish tank and he is going to win.",

                "comment": "I am a Sam fan and have been for years. There are so many fucking new fags in these threads that I\u2019ve never seen his past material, don\u2019t know his shtick, never seen world peace, Never seen as Hyde wars stuff, never seen his gum Road shit, whatever. But I will say I think the way they handled the situation last night with Simmons was, while very entertaining, not the best way to do it. It obviously fucked with the house extremely, and to their credit they probably didn\u2019t see that coming. I didn\u2019t either. I think for well-adjusted people who know they are on a reality show, they would shrug it off and move forward to play the game. That\u2019s what you do on these kinds of things. But instead they filled a house full of autists and autists are easily rattled. For as gentle as they have been on certain aspects of the show, it would\u2019ve been more appropriate to take some downstairs, tell him what\u2019s up, tell him to pack his shit and that he has five minutes to do so and don\u2019t talk to anyone. Thank you never have to turn the cams on, no one is puking up their guts drunk, and everybody is still trying to figure out what\u2019s going on and you have a great product that keeps producing solid content like this thing has been for the past four nights. But instead we wanted our epic YouTube clip, so now everything has come to a screeching halt and who knows what we will get when things finally get back to \u201cnormal\u201d. For as much experience as Sam has, all the producers of this shit have been amateur. Some of it has increased the quality of the show, while other instances have obviously hurt it, such as last night.",

It's a story that will chill you to the bone, and it's one that we need to remember so that it never happens again.\n\nBack in 2007, a man named Jonathan decided to participate in a big-brother style livestream where he and a few other participants would live in a house with cameras streaming every moment. Jonathan was excited to be a part of the experiment and looked forward to the challenge of living in front of the camera.\n\nUnfortunately, things quickly took a turn for the worse. Jonathan drank too much alcohol during the stream and, to make matters worse, had only been drinking coffee the week before. This led to dehydration, and despite the fact that thousands of people were watching the stream, nobody realized what was happening until it was too late...",
