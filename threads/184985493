                "comment": ">>184986113\nJosie is a DiaperFur\n\nParaphilic infantilism, also known as autonepiophilia and adult baby, is a sexual fetish that involves role-playing a regression to an infant-like state. Paraphilic infantilism is a form of ageplay. People who practice paraphilic infantilism are often colloquially referred to (by themselves and others) as \"adult babies\", or \"ABs\".\n\nBehaviors may include things such as wearing childish clothes, wearing or using diapers, cuddling with stuffed animals, drinking from a bottle or sucking on a pacifier, and (when done with others) engaging in gentle and nurturing experiences, baby talk, or BDSM power dynamics involving masochism, coercion, punishment or humiliation.\n\nParaphilic infantilism is often associated with diaper fetishism, a separate but related kink in which people derive sexual pleasure from themselves or others wearing or using diapers, without necessarily involving any form of ageplay. People with a diaper fetish are often informally called \"diaper lovers\", or \"DLs\". In practice, these strict labels do not always reflect the true diversity of sexual expression. As such, when considered together, paraphilic infantilism and diaper fetishism form a spectrum of behaviors that are often colloquially referred to under the umbrella term \"adult baby/diaper lover\", or \"AB/DL\" (also spelled \"ABDL\").\n\nLike other sexual fetishes (paraphilias), there is no single recognized cause for paraphilic infantilism and little research has been done on the subject. A variety of theories have been proposed for fetish development, including unique lovemaps, imprinting or altered erotic targets, though there is no scientific consensus. Paraphilic infantilism may be linked to masochism, urolagnia, garment fetishes or other kinks, however it is not to be confused with pedophilia, as people with this fetish are not attracted to children and do not seek them as sexual partners.",

Women in the furry community are rare so they usually get shared by multiple guys. Women use this to their advantage by catfishing and using simps. From what I've seen and what other anons are saying she's likely heavily into stuff like ageplay and is some sort of \"diaperfur\" so she's literally the female version of pamperchu. Which makes a lot of sense if her \"nose\" is broken its because she spends a lot of time sniffing shit and its why bad smelling things don't bother her.\n\nI had a phase where I thought I was a furry and the first guy I meet is in an erelationship with multiple people at the same time and had the dude move to his country and hes literally talking and flirting with people online entering relationships trying to amass a harem or some shit while also keeping it a secret because he was a degenerate faggot. Josie is likely doing that exact same thing becuase all furries are the same. A bunch of fucking weirdo pedophiles that catfish and amass simps",

But he admits himself that there is nothing wrong with his GF having an Onlyfans account. I like Idubbbz and watched his videos many times, but we all knew his GF was a thot. Even more, a really shitty human being. Especially from her reaction to Pyro's Twitch streamers video. What's more, people looking genuinely devastated and hating on Idubbbz is really overreacting at this point. Making simp memes are all cool but people have been writing fucking novels how Idubbbz thot GF and his simpness basically ruined their life, lol. The dude himself says that he has no problem with his GF being a sex worker, and he likes sluttiness, so power to him, why do we even care if that's not going to change his ways from now on? People think that Idubbbz is going against his thought logic because of his GF being like the douchetubers Idubbbz made Content Cops about. But Anisa is not ''that'' bad compared to Keemstar or Tana Mongeau. She is dislikable, but Ian apparently loves her and they are in a good cucky relationship. So why do we care?\n\nPersonally, I think Idubbbz deserves much more than Anisa but if he is okay with this, then this doesn't affect us in any way at all. This is the most retarded drama of the year. I miss the days of Gnomestar and Leafy dramas.",

                "comment": "One thing that bothers me about how Jet is handling Fishtank. Look at the fucking lootboxes. 300 dollars for a box to give to a contestant. The lootbox has like 2 one dollar drinks and a pack of 2 dollar snacks, throw in a little 50 cent fidget spinner. Here's your retarded lootbox, bro.\nIt's stupid. It's not interesting for anyone, it's not worth the money and if you are one of the paypigs who bought a lootbox you will be disappointed and won't buy another one. It loses money for Fishtank too as less people buy these.\n\nWays to fix it. You get to attach your message to the lootbox so you at least get some interaction. The lootbox contents have to be actually random, have Jet and the tard crew roll a random number generator to decide what goes in it. Like in a video game the loot also has to have tiers. Common loot like shitty cheap snacks, rare loot slightly more expensive stuff and legendary loot which is all sorts of perks and prizes.\nThe shitty little snacks add nothing to the show. The very least they could do is add some silly clothing to the crates like t-shirts and hats that would be visually interesting and novel enough to be worn. You could have a 1 in 100 chance to get a fishbuck in the crate. 1 in 200 chance to get elimination immunity and the paypig will be happy that he kept someone in the game by paypigging. Have rare loot in the crate that gives you a voucher like turn off TTS in one room for the entire day so you can make your room quiet and get good sleep while everyone else gets spammed with TTS all night.\nThere is so much you can do with the lootcrates that isn't just a snack refill. It's not like they're even short on food. Like they couldn't even deprive them of all food and force them to eat only lootbox food. Just have a lootbox come in with steak and who got the lootbox decides who gets to eat and now has bargaining power, can trade a piece of steak with a bottle of vodka someone got from their lootbox. Lootbox economy, make them barter.",
