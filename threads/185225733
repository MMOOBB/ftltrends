The harsh treatment is a cover to make it less obvious, but it's nothing harsh enough to make her leave. Frank is the only thing that's ever genuinely gotten to her and he's open about the fact that he has no idea what the crew plans and has no involvement outside of them wanting him to come and do his thing. It was the one time she cried and she was about to leave, then Sam literally pulled her into B4 bathroom to give her a pep talk and convince her to stay.\nShe will \"win\" immunity and then they will probably send Josie home because she doesn't make money from TTSes or plushies anymore.",

Josie was kind of neat at first with the wholesome autistic stimming thing but I think she has run her course on the show and her life will be better for the time she spent here. I think a lot of the Josie simping at this point just stems from Letty hate and her being not Letty.\nRegardless, I don't think the viewers will decide who wins the 30k so whatever. I think it would be interesting to see the head to head showdown of Letty enjoyers supporting her and Letty haters trying to project some kind of value onto the void that is Vance",
