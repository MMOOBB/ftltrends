Two most likely explanations:\n\nScenario 1. He confessed to Letty that while he was also interested in her, her very public advances made him feel he had to make an equally public rejection for the sake of his relationship with his (supposed) girlfriend.\nThis explains why Letty felt the need to bring it up to the other fish (face-saving) and why she was so giddy talking about it (having her crush requited), and why it would mess with his personal life to reveal it.\n\nScenario 2. He confessed to her that he's gay. This explains Letty giggling, because of how ridiculous his persona seems in retrospect, also straight women find the idea of a man being gay inherently hilarious and fascinating. Also makes being rejected less painful. Also explains why it would mess with his personal life to reveal it.\n\nOr he told her that he's saving himself for marriage which would also cause her to find it funny and potentially embarrassing (men who say this are usually mocked)",
