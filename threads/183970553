I saved a copy since it provides some insight into metrics, you can download it here files catbox moe/nxftig.json\nThis is a set of all the polls between the dates Apr 25 2023 16:01:46 UTC+0 and Apr 28 2023 05:59:22 UTC+0 and includes not only the results, but also a per user breakdown of who voted for what and with how many votes (you can paypig for more vote power)\n\nI wrote a basic script to calculate some metrics (https://pastebin.com/N9XYPPDH - paste it into devtools after setting data to equal the json file if you want to run it):\npolls made: 159\ntotal users that voted on these polls: 3365\n\n>(Cont.)",

If you assume one pass per voter then that's $135k, but that assumption is shaky.\n\nWhilst I think it's possible to buy goytokens without a season pass and vote with them, it seems highly unlikely someone would do that and not buy a season pass. Conversely, it's not unlikely for someone to buy a season pass but not bother wasting thei goytokens on largely meaningless polls. The ratio of voters to season pass holders is left to guesswork for now. If someone with time and technical skills is interested in estimating it better, then scrape the chat data and count up userIds of people posting in it. Then count up how many of those userIds voted, then the ratio.\n\nThis would be best done with fresh poll data but when I checked the site again today it was no longer sending that data by default. I don't have time to figure out how to hijack the ws and experiment with trying to explicitly request that data, but it also seems like polls stopped being made as of late? Maybe jet inept noticed that page loads were raping the db and killed it to save on billing.",

Somewhere along the way it became more of a 24/7 stream instead of challenges that have them going to Cartoon Network studios and the like. \n\nI blame Jet. Id like to think it has to do with legal at first, but now the reason everything is so tame is because Sam is scared of people leaving. Almost 4 people left when he projected his pedophilia onto Simmons. He has to regret that in hindsight.\n\nAlso the contestants are all in on it with their frequent return of their phones",

I will say though after they stopped refunding if your option lost I stopped voting in polls and haven't voted since the site went back up. I suspect the same is true for a sizeable amount of other pass holders. Like the other anon said, if you assume anyone who voted in a poll has probably bought a pass that's easily over 135k in pass sales, but I suspect the true amount may be as much as two or three times that number. Not to mention all the revenue from TTS/fishtoy sales. This actually will probably end up being profitable despite the insane hosting + other costs",
