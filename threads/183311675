This is called scalability in a project - how much tolerance did you build into the budget to scale in the event that it's less, or more, successful than you anticipated? And the thing is, I think they had the tolerance to handle the success the project was getting, but (as plenty of other have pointed out) the hosting cost actually skyrocketed because each person streaming is essentially the same as 10 from a bandwidth standpoint. So they probably had the tolerance to handle 60k streamers, but their bandwidth cost is closer to 600k because each browser is running each stream simultaneously. If they actually had that many viewers, they could easily pay their bills, but they don't. However, their bandwidth usage is reflecting like that's the case. I mean, it's a problem that can happen - I get it, but you would hope they thought about that possibility before starting up a project that is run 100% 24/7 online via streams. none of them are Dev Ops of Application Engineers or anything, so I don't lay the blame completely on them for not thinking about it. However, they should chew out whoever they have as the \"tech guy\" on their production.",

The weeb developers that are helping to resolve the issue said he should be able to set it up with a much cheaper vendor (and presumably they can also improve the site's optimization).",

I get it if you are a teen and do something as a hobby, but let's say you eventually want to make it a full time job, how much time are you willing to put into something you know that has to remain anon and free (because these fucking days they'll fucking end up tracing you for saying anything) ?\nSome guys can afford it, and it will be a great learning experience. Most people know that time is finite and if you are in your mid 20s and have no real income/portfolio you are kinda fucked.\nHell, what do you think it's better in a long run ? A niche game that can bring you a lot of trouble in the future, or a game that has potential to lowkey redpill people, make money and build for portfolio/exposure ?\nLike with AS and MDE, they said to him to close the fucking reddit and tone down a little (I know they were paying them shit).\nToday we might have how many seasons of a well produced MDE WP ? Hell, even with the exposure they would have gotten by it they could have gone of the leash and make their own WP uncensored and just make everything bigger.",
