She even told me that she wanted to run away with me and that she wanted to pack her bags and we'll move to the next city the same very night, After turning her down she cried a bunch and started blaming me and acting like it was my fault for making her feel that way and she gave me a lot of silent treatment around that time.\n\nShe use to tell me how strongly she believed that i was her soulmate and that she's never had a connection with someone like me before and she burst out into tears some nights and tell me the thought of me being there with her made her so happy she would literally just break down crying.\n\nEventually near the end of our relationship i had a bunch of problems with her that i would bring up and she wasn't having any of that shit. She just would tell all our friends that i was an abusive desperate asshole to her and keep telling me that im a narcissist and a mean person, After a huge argument we had she ghosted me randomly and less then a week later she was dating some huge tall buff body builder and constantly throwing subliminal digs at me on her social media. Half a year later she started trying to contact me again and i just never replied and deleted her contacts on everything. She has continued messaging me asking how i am and why i deleted her on everything and how badly she wants to see me again on my phone till this very day about once every quarter of the year and this break up happened about 3 years ago.\n\nWorst part is that i still miss her sometimes.",

She's nothing like Letty, there are multiple different types of BPD so that explains why. We're finally splitting up after all these years but somehow Im the one who doesn't want it. She found out I looked up porn 3 years into our marriage and destroyed all my shit, though she looked up porn too. \n\nThen, i stopped doing it cause admittedly it was retarded and made our relationship worse, but that wasn't good enough. She lost all trust in me for the next 4 years, though never outright admitting it. Even going on 4chan is a problem for her. She'd throw my belongings, punch me, slap the taste out of my mouth, break my computer over the slightest suspiciouns or just cause I \"ruined her life\" until eventually I just sat there with a blank stare and endured it. I will never lay my hands on a woman but I ALMOST felt the urge through that shit. She'd say she would leave but she \"couldn't\". So it would repeat again, cause once again I was too convinced things would work out. They didn't and Ive felt like a stupid bitch ever since. It was both our fault, i definitely blame myself for being so blind and not telling her to fuck off. She'd spurt off \"i dont love you\" every argument, i did it once and she completely broke down. Made me feel like absolute shit, then I realized how fucked it was she could say it and not care 50 times but the one time I say it she breaks\n\nSry for the blog. Just dont fuck with these kinds of people, or if you do then do your research",

I eventually moved partway across the country to get away from her cause she would come into work and frequently contact my family to try to talk to me again. I now split rent with one of those world of warcraft buddies, bros before hoes [spoiler]she still tries to contact me online as recently as last week and has on two occasions made steam accounts and once made a WoW account to try to contact me while pretending to be somebody else at first and I regret trying to show her those hobbies since almost two years after I last saw her she uses that knowledge to find me online over and over[/spoiler]",
