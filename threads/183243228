He's really obvious and bad at acting so I don't know how he got hired, Sam is usually on point with this stuff like that crackhead girl he said was his girlfriend, she did such an amazing job but this guy sleeps all day and then yells out of nowhere and it's supposed to be funny or shocking.",

If you're willing to take your time, join communities related to your interests and make friends, whether they're women or not you'll be better off. IT HAS TO ACTUALLY BE YOUR INTEREST. You cannot and will not successfully find a girlfriend by pretending to like something or joining communities purely to look for girls. I found my gf of years while looking for gifs of a show I liked on tumblr, saw her post a funny selfie and said hello, found we got along really well. That's how it works, have a common interest to break ice then start talking, if it works you fall in love if not you can be friends or just drift apart, whatever. Point is I wasn't actively looking for girls it just happened while doing what I was doing anyway.",

Cringe behavior and he should stop being a faggot and let people say what that want to about contestants if he's going to be a cunt to Jon over something he cannot control.",
