                "comment": "I wonder if Josie will take up the role of house cleaner and keep the place tidy in Jon's absence. It was obvious right off the bat that she had the same type of OCD Jon did. Jon curbed it by doing all the house chores and cleaning to get over the mudaneness of the fishtank. Josie would have to find her own way of curbing her tics, she already said she does not have autism. With Jon gone now Josie will be the compulsive cleaning queen.",

This is not good for the health of the show and it didn't have to happen if Sam didn't listen to all the clips channels spamming him with fake screenshots that Simmons never wrote, or taking his plagiarized books out of context. Even the one with the 'small penis' is comlpletly ripped off from a youtube video. It's not Simmons own words.\nhttps://youtu.be/fwlDB5IovCc?t=264",
