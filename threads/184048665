                "comment": ">>184048824\nLetty\u2019s skinny physique increases the amount of piss in her body (proportionately). If a 100 lb woman has 1 liter of piss in her bladder, and a 200 lb woman has 1 liter of piss in her bladder; proportionately speaking, the 100lb woman has twice as much piss. Letty has piss in her veins. The high concentration of piss becomes refined over time and forms a new substance with finer qualities. This gives her a type of aura (a piss aura) and the fumes seep into the pores of those around her, gradually causing them to fall under her sway. The piss residue sinks it\u2019s way ito the deepest recesses of your mind, body, and spirit. Even when letty is not around, the piss is still inside you, tormenting you, causing you to want to fuck her. \nVery dangerous. If one were to give into the piss then he would be obsessed, like a zombie, fully subordinate to the piss. Sam is able to see the signs. He is trying hard to resist the urge to fuck letty - for even a pump and dump would cause him to succumb to her magic. Sam also knows how catastrophic it would be to Jon if he were to fall for this, so he has to protect Jon.\nThis is not about \u201cfunny gameshow ha ha\u201d anymore. This is a code red situation. Letty is a category 5 piss witch, and the producers don\u2019t know how dangerous this situation is",

Tranny shit is everywhere for zoomers, and it's being drilled into their heads at a young age. Any person who is autistic (or is just a slightly strange outcast type of person) might latch onto the tranny shit because they think they reason they are different is because \"I was born in the wrong body\". Just look at the autism rates among trannies vs the general population... the tranny shit targets these people. \n That being said, I don't think Josie thinks like that now, just going by the things she has said on fishtank.",

She should also have men in her life to protect her from this stuff - like her father for example, but modern fathers don\u2019t protect their daughters like this.
