There will be immunity challenges and contestants will get voted out. Jet and his sharks will come up with the most timid and tame pranks that the contestants barely even respond to. Last person to remain might win $30,000.\n\n>How to watch (FREE TO WATCH, BUT NEED TO SIGN UP)\n\u2022 https://www.fishtank.live \u2022\n\n>Alternative re-streams sites:\nhttps://fishtank.maggot.cx/\n\n>Better fishtank script for adding basic website functionality that Jet couldn't\nhttps://github.com/BowDown097/BetterFishtank\n\n>Bash scripts for playing feeds in mpv\nhttps://pastebin.com/6w70t1Sy\nhttps://pastebin.com/dfAwAgbg\n\n>Clips and highlights:\nhttps://twitter.com/fishtankdotlive\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAQwT5kNDAZ5at1awBGofrng-5mhJ0tw0\nhttps://pastebin.com/gmEqG2px\n\nPrevious: >>183993796",

                "comment": "First off, viewership is trending DOWNWARD in a big way - this is a fact. And do not brush it over with the whole \"it was always going to drop off\" bullshit. Viewership increased steadily day after day up until the Simmons incident. \nSince then, each day has been lower than the last. Yesterday is the first time Sam hasn't shown up and there was no real challenge of any kind.\nSo what went wrong, unironically? I'm going to list a few things:\n>Inconsistency on rules for contestants and audience involvement. At first the production issues were novel, put now that things are smoothed out it feel like they are simply moving the show in whatever direction brings in the most simp bucks\n>Kicking out Simmons in such a dramatic fashion, causing Maruo to walk out the same day. Say what you want about Simmons, but I think everyone can mostly agree the situation should have been handled differently and the fallout has been detrimental to the show\n>Challenges and eliminations largely being done away with and seemingly not being enforced or upheld in any way. You need some constants on the show.\n>The way the sharks interact with the fish. At this point I think everyone can agree the fish have been spoiled to a certain degree, completely altering the dynamic of the show (for the worst)\n>24/7 TTS, while a money-maker, is better used an hour or two a day to fuck with the vibe of the house and get the Fish talking\nThere's a lot more I can list, but I think anyone who has tuned in from day one will agree this thing is simply turning in whatever will keep the simp bucks flowing. It's like an odd version of a hottub stream at this point. Which is a shame, because peak viewership was happening when the show was much closer to how it was originally intended. Now, everyday is bleeding viewers and Sam isn't even showing up.",
