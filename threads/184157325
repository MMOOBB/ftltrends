Just repeating what they said.\nI think a lot of people forget that people who don't know Sam, and see him when he did the Simmons eviction like some of the people in the house was really intimidating from their perspective.

Not because of the show or something, but because i knew he nedeed the money, and he did not kill he soul for It, that's why he didn't get It. It's hard, and it's not being a schizo or something, it's real, and i'm proud of him for It, but that doesn't make It less sad.

He already told Vance that he wanted to leave with Mauro that night and that's what brought around the pizza party and light touch they gave him the rest of the way. He was skipping challenges for the better part of a week. He kept telling people his anxiety was through the roof. He told Vance again last night when he was holed up in the bathroom after they breached the bedroom door he was thinking of leaving. He came up with the story about his behavior being part of the act to save face because that's all he cares about is appearing tough. We know this because that's Tate's whole deal.\nJon already declared he wouldn't quit because he has to be the tough guy. So he left them no choice but to put on a dog and pony show to give him his graceful exit, and he still announced to the room he would have left anyways if he won.",

But in Jon's perspective, he most likely felt uncomfortable when they started doing the retard disability roleplay challenges, and everyone was doing somewhat of a Jon impersonation.\n\nJon having autism and a speech impediment probably got him bullied and teased in real life. Most likely being called retarded all his life. So when everyone in the show, chat, tts, and threads were all calling him that, on top of the challenge were they were backhandedly making fun of him. He must have thought, \"damn, do you guys really think I'm like that?\"\n\nSo hurt and offended that he locked himself in his room. Only to be berated more by the chat. So when he loses and says that he was going to tell Sam that he wanted to go home regardless, I believe it. He must have felt humiliated, for something he is self conscious about.\n\nBut ultimately, that passing 5 second conversation where Damiel says \n>sorry for calling you retarded.\nAnd Jon replies with \n>It's all good, I get that a lot.\nIt truly was a \"you too, Brutus?\" moment, to a group of people he thought wouldn't make fun of him.",

It seemed like Jon was really trying for a bit trying to find that phone and doing a high pitched voice (which I guess to him meant being downs?) and then going apeshit at the end along with everyone else. But yeah, he just couldn't break his morals and go full retard (kind of ironic).\n\nI really admire the kid for not being afraid of being himself.

Jon was clearly upset and they shouldn't have continued on.\n\nObviously you should push them to be uncomfortable and annoyed, I mean that's the point of the show. But it's not fun to see someone actually shut down and go unresponsive. There should be some kind of middle ground. Jet coming out and telling Jon to just be a good sport and play along probably didn't help either.",
