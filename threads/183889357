There may not be enough evidence to definitively conclude that he's a pedophile but between the books and instagram posts it was all still very weird and creepy, and had they not removed him they would have been getting shit from people for letting a pedophile stay on. I can agree that the way in which he was removed probably wasn't the best and that it should've been handled more discretely, but I still don't think what Sam did qualifies as defamation.",

He was the first person to actually challenge Jon, he had zero comprehension of how jokes work, his improv had the rest of the contestants on suicide watch constantly, etc\n\nI don't think Sam really had much to fear from people accusing him of letting a pedo on, what with simmons not being one and all, and also the fact that the loudest accusers hang onto Sam's nuts and wouldn't be accusing if he told them not to. I do however think that if in spite of all that he was still scared of potential repercussions he should have simply tossed simmons out normally for failing a challenge rather than having a meltdown over it.\n\nWhat's also worth mentioning however is that this wasn't a spur of the moment thing for Sam. He and the crew had clearly been planning this for several days in advance so as to maximise the situation, what with the babies, the karaoke, and so on. It's pretty evident that he did it for cheap entertainment rather than an actual fear of legal issues.\n\n>I still don't think what Sam did qualifies as defamation\nSam calls him a pedophile in the first minute and a half of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzjm4MuWMq4",

If anyone is touched and subsequently discovers something that would have caused them to withhold consent had they known at the time, they can sue the producers for not upholding their duty owed to contestants. Not worth leaving him on the show and waiting to see if anyone decided this later (they 100% would have).",

There's some things that would help his case, other things that would harm it. On balance what sticks out to me most though is that he has a reasonable shot at one because as you say the contestants keep airing false allegations and death threats and the producers are allowing this to happen and be viewed by thousands of people. Then you can point to all the secondary podcasts and streams and whatnot where yet more people, some of which are affiliated with Sam and the show, continue to make defamatory statements and death threats. Wrap all that up with the fact that Sam has plenty of wealthy enemies who hate him for various reasons and there's reason to believe that simmons could quite readily get funding for a lawsuit.\n\nIs simmons guaranteed to win one? Not at all, but even a failed one would cost Sam significant time and money when he's meant to be busy reviving WP2.",

They've been reassured that they're all walking with some cash, that the mean TTS won't go through, that they can dip out and chill in the basement if things ever get too bad, etc\n\nBy this point the entire thing is basically scripted and you'll see contestants leave for failing challenges or something as it gets nearer to the end and they'll walk with whatever cash their fishbucks equated to.",
