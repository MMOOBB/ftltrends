If I saw a creepy sperg 30 year old chinese man start dating my daughter the day she turned 18 I'd beat him to death with a hammer.\n\nSimmons is a weird undie sniffing restraining order having sperg.

Just because you only heard of it through a YouTube video because you don't read, does not mean that everyone else is like you. Your anti intellectualism and aggressive media illiteracy is not welcome here. There are striking parallels to the text occurring in Fish Tank. Most strikingly seen in Sam's treatment of Simmons and the audience's subsequent reaction / The Judge's treatment of Reverend Green and the crowd's reaction. Second most strikingly represented by Sam's relationship with Jon and The Judge's relationship with The Idiot. These parallels are ripe for discussion. As Cormac McCarthy said, books are made of books.",
