I know why he is so nervous though so far this project seems to be one big money sink and he is desperately trying to make it back before it can collapse. $75 for TTS, $60 to turn a camera back on after someone payed $101 to turn it off for literally no benefit other than denying content to the viewers, $200 to change the temperature in the house, and who could forget paying $600 to takeaway somebodies bed for the night(which isn't much of a threat considering people have already slept on the couch) or switch everything from the freezer into the fridge? I don't envy the position he has put himself in with this, but making the content as boring as possible so that it drags on to the finish line isn't really entertaining.",
