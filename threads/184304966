There will be challenges for fishbucks (which are worth $500 each) and elimination challenges. Jet and his sharks will come up with the most timid and tame pranks that the contestants barely even respond to.

You watch these guys talk to eachother and then a guy in a white suit comes out from the basement and throws shit everywhere. Everything that happened was unexpected and new. The first time people saw the guys in suits chat went wild ''oh shit, it's the entity, the entity is here.''\nNow it's a routine. Sleep for 12 hours. 8 hours sitting around doing nothing. Two mini challenges at a set schedule. There's no one coming out at night to fuck with them.\n\nIt's so predictable that you know the two times a day you should check in and see what the gimmick is. Compare that to first week when you had highlights throughout the day.",

I don't know how he thinks locking things behind paywalls forever is the way to go, if he doesn't want his fanbase to slowly just dwindle to nothing. If when he was doing all of that Happy World Daddy shit, it just went straight up to Youtube after a month or two, people would have actually seen it.",

Last night for example when Sylvia and Letty were going at it, Jet just walks in and goes \"Let's do a rap battle!\".
