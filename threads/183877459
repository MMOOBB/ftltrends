He wasn't even a good agent of chaos, ooh, you jumped up on the counter and pretended to be a monkey? woah bro.\n\nthen he's put back in and is just boring as fuck and sleeps all day, he doesn't even have any fans so isn't making them any money via superchat, he isn't generating any content except for being a sounding board for vance who inexplicably has a lot of fans, he's lame as fuck.",

I don't think the people who are running this are nice because they changed their mind about the direction of the show because they're the one who created it in the first place. What did they expect would happen if they psychologically tortured 6 autistic people. Once they actually started to fold they pulled the plug and now it just feels fake.

Infinite is the best a \"modern\" Halo game could possibly be, shame that it's a total content drought and rife with networking issues and some incredibly jewish monetization.",

The reason he never says or does anything for vast swathes of the day is because he's planning his next epic move that'll garner tons of upboats and be clipped and shared everywhere. EVERY SINGLE TIME that shit falls completely flat. He's the fish that thinks the most about his actions to an excruciating degree and obviously cares about what the viewers think of him the most. The worst part is I'm pretty sure he thinks he's winning the show and must have the most fans. I bet in his head he's imagining his Vance Pill video has the most views out of all the fish tank content and his le epic baby stealing move he just did is gonna secure his status at the top.\n\nHe has no fucking idea he's universally hated for the way he's living in the tank. The way he's playing the game should actually get him kicked out. Even fucking DAMIEL who's the plant understands the point of the show is not to be constantly trying to meta-game your actions and telegraph everything to impress the audience. The point is to just exist alongside the other fishes and the content develops organically. EVERYONE ELSE understands this EXCEPT VANCE.\n\nFUCK THIS NIGGER GET HIM OUT OF HERE.",

Sam originally sold it as the worst people ever that youd love to torture, which is true for most reality tv because theyre all narcissistic materialists. But everyone in the show theyve chosen are people who would regularly get bullied and even for Sam it would be kind of sickening for the entertainment to come from bullying these autists on a massive documented scale.\nI even dont think Sam was too out of line with the Simmons thing. I think he handled it poorly but he never said he was a pedo just quoted his published stuff. The gross stuff that followed was from discord fags, frank hassle and twitter normies.\n\nThey just need better rules so theres not any blatant favouritism (josies and her plushies for example, maybe give them all a unique fishtoy) and to come up with tough challenges that doesnt make their shortcomings the butt of the joke.",

He's lied to Letty about jobs he's, children, fights etc in a one-on-one situation.\n\n'Not calling someone a retard to their face' & 'compulsively lying about everything to make yourself seem better than anyone' exist on the same continuum of ego-defense, but not blatantly insulting someone is empathetic & considerate while blatantly lying is disrespectful & domineering.\n\nJon thinks he's better than everyone, but he struggles to justify in hard terms why that's so. So when put on the spot he confabulates scenarios that lift him above others\n>knows BJJ\n>bit some guys balls\n>isn't a sinner like everyone else\n>owns a restaurant\n>has 3 kids\n>is a firefighter\n\nThe only time he's honest is when people mercilessly rail on him with the truth - they call him a stupid autistic retard for 10 minutes. This strips away the protective lies he tells himself and others to prove his superiority and he's left with a realisation of his existence but this is too much for him so he CRIES LIKE A 5 YEAR OLD. He bawls while locked in a bathroom.\n\nThe ONLY time Jon is honest is when people are honest with him, which brings him down to his lowest state. Yet they aren't allowed to do that because he's so fragile.\n\nIt's unhealthy to worship his petulant displays of faux masculinity and superiority as anything but the mimicry of a mental child.",
