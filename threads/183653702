He was entertaining at first, but then when he started tryharding (probably because of positive TTS making his ego too big), and throwing a bitch fit to get kicked out because Jon told him off. So why is he even back? Seems pretty fucking retarded, hopefully he'll just be back for the challenge, just makes him seem like a mega bitch since he needed a 2 day break because he couldn't handle Jon of all people talking back to him.",
