It probably would've taken me much longer if it weren't for the encouragement I got from my family and friends. Those self-deprecating thoughts totally still cross my mind, but they're much easier to cope with than they used to be. I came to the realization that wanting something for myself wasn't enough; I need to actually put the work in to get where I want to be.\n>i probably cant talk more than 10 minutes unless I'm talking about something im passionate about and the problem with that is i start getting doubts about people's level of care for it, about me wasting their time\nIt gets easier with practice, and people tune into streams to watch people get enthusiastic about things. There's likely at least a handful of people out there that are into whatever you're into. I think the only person whose time you should truly worry about wasting is your own. People who make you feel like you waste their time are certainly not worth yours.",
