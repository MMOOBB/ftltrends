Will make it to the very end but not win.\n\nVance > Littlefinger\n\nHe\u2019s entertaining as a villain and seems charismatic and smart at time but is not smart enough to win and will be killed off sometime around the end.\n\nMauro > Varys\n\nSchemes behind the scenes, is portly yet graceful, and has no sexual energy about him whatsoever. Slightly smarter than Vance behind the scenes but will be killed off all the same for taking the wrong side at some point if he\u2019s not the last one standing.\n\nJohn > Bobby B\n\nSeverely loud, brash, sexually charged and severely autistic to the point of being completely blind to the views of others. Constantly trying to assert dominance and throw his physical strength around while making up ridiculous stories about his past exploits and drinking. Will be gone and leave a giant void in the show early.\n\nSylvia > THE BLOODY BOAR\n\nDamiel > Joffrey\n\nPetulant, scheming, and downright evil at times but he\u2019s fun to watch and he\u2019s basically the villain of the entire thing. He isn\u2019t smart or tactful however and is prone to severe tantrums that make him look like a baby.\n\nJosie > Hodor\n\nPerfectly content in her own little world carrying around smaller beings and repeating the same autistic quotes over and over. Needs mental stimulation because she\u2019s basically a child. Critical darling that will be killed off tragically somewhere near the end in probably the best elimination in the show.\n\nSimmons I\u2019m thinking either Tyrion or Reek.\n\nTyiron because he\u2019s vilified and there are rumors about him being a creepy freak.\n\nReek because he was sissified at the behest of the other cast members.",

If you can simply prove that you have the correct DNA you get royalties, more money than most people who work make, for nothing. No strings attached, you just get a paycheck every month.\nYou never have to worry about your bills and you have this cool mystical mythos attached to you. You can walk around dressed in your feathers and LARP as a wise Injun and people will not fuck with you.\nOut of all the minorities they got the worst genocide and treatment, and they came out of it as winners.

The heart to heart was good shit though. The bedroom stuff was funny too. Those are all the main funny positive notes, the criticism is that half of the start of the day was painful with non-stop screaming, and no real goldstriker action, nor any challenges or anything as a group as such, nor TTS or fan engagement. It was a slow day with some kino appearing near the end, I'd say 7/10 is fair maybe 8/10",

Once the suspension is resolved, the API key should regain its functionality, and you should be able to access Firebase resources again.",
