That shit had to be the tightest, brownest, wettest boy pussy I\u2019ve ever laid pipe into. I swear to God, the most heavenly high is gargling that wonderboy\u2019s nuts while going fist deep into his shitter. I had Damiel screaming in the sheets with head too ridiculous to ignore. That nigga frotted my cock until he busted on my mouth, I had to return the favor. That nigga Damiel and I been fucking non-stop ever since, but keep that shit on the DL. He does that shit for free. If you\u2019re gonna ask me how to \u201clong\u201d the Bummy Buster, I\u2019ll be deadass. All you gotta do is ask, be straight up, and get physical real quick. Touch his nuts, get on ya knees, talk your shit. He doesn\u2019t play around with no pansy-ass niggas either. He likes his men manly, and his dick thick. Dark skin, 6\u20195 is the minimum and I ain\u2019t talking about height boy.\nThat nigga Damiel stole my heart and drank my seed.",
