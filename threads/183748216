He is a sociopathic scumbag who alienated everyone he worked with.\nHe is incapable of not sabotaging everything he ever worked on. Fishtank had failure after failure, the swatting, the site going down twice, constant issues with TTS and cameras, and lag. Issues on top of issues. And then they got it working, everything is fine, we are cruising. And this fucking retard decides to accuse a contestant of being a pedophile and gloat about how he will be homeless based on some twitter lynch mob. Zero professionalism. Like they couldn't have just kicked him off because he is on the losing team. Simmons was going to be kicked off no matter what, everything was going great. Letty and Vance made sure that he would go home, but no, Sam Hyde has to come in and shit over the entire project so bad that no one wants to be there anymore. There is nothing that they could do that will top them ruining the life of a guy for no reason.\n>hurr hurr next day we will come in with balloons and put stinky gas whoopie cushies on your seats hohoho\n>don't forget to take care of your stupid faggot plastic baby!!!\nAre you retarded?

This consists of him peeking under fish's blankets while they are trying to sleep, checking the laundry room multiple times and failing to see it, and taking advice from Letty/Vance (sigh)\n> Jon does find the baby after a long and retarded search, and begins to ponder about who could have done such a thing\n> Meanwhile TTS is enabled\n> A Brutal Mk-Ultra Sesh begins where Jon is simultaneously called a Godly Good Boy and a Speech-deprived Retard. Jon handles this by silently staring at the floor, fake reading the bible, and prison push-ups\n> Also, like several dozen TTs's come in accusing Simmons of being a Pedo Camp Counselor. The other Fish become confused and frightened by this (espcially Mauro) while Simmons fails to defend himself\n> After a while of this bullshit, Jon/Simmons go up to their room to hatch a revenge plan\n> This Part gets a little hazy (Jon's lisp), but they come up with some kinda scheme where Simmons hides with their baby in the Bathroom while Jon goes tries to steal everyone elses babies \n> Jon picks Vance/Letty as his first target and heads to Mauro/Sylvia's room (?)\n> In what is one of the most retarded things ever witnessed, Jon sees a Fat Brownskin Hispanic Man and mistakes him for Vance, grabs the baby and starts to run off\n> Mauro, who is equal parts confused and pissed, intercepts Jon and gets the Baby back",

And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.",

Sam Hyde was screaming like a retard outside of the door mocking Jon with his dumb speech and Mauro came out of the room and wanted to talk to Sam. This is where he was already deciding to leave. It seems like Mauro didn't appreciate how upset Jon was and how Sam was just clowning on him.\nJon also refused to open the door for Sam. Jon isn't dumb, he saw how cruel Sam was and how no one was given a chance to judge Simmons for themselves. Jon legit wanted to wait for the books to arrive and see exactly what was written in them.",

I feel like doing the baby challenge caused the other contestants to feel even more uncomfortable around Simmons. It's also shitty that they were fucking with him for taking the baby into the bathroom, when it wasn't exactly his idea to look after a plastic doll to begin with, it was Sam's/Jets. They basically fucked Simmons to the max over nothing.",
