You\u2019re all think about, all I dream about. I watch you everyday from the basement cameras and my heart aches. Let me take you away from all of this. This house, this show.

They'll likely give freeloaders an out and say they don't have to take it because Chris sure as shit isn't going to fit in one of these and Frank is a maybe. It'll be interesting to see if Sylvia manages to squeeze herself in though.\n\nIt's honestly weird how the whole thing has simultaneously really high production value (the house is nice and there really isn't any nickel & diming going on), but the most scuffed execution possible. It's pretty obvious by now that the producers aren't capable of thinking more than 10 minutes ahead/don't really give a shit anymore, but if you want to make a show that lasts for like 2 months, you have to at least roughly map it out. I bet the producers read one of these threads, saw the IQ test suggestion, were like \"lets have them take a PSAT\", and everything is going to be figured out on the fly in a really cringy way.",

It makes the guy feel bonded to her, makes him weaker by comparison etc. If you think men and women can have \"normal conversations\" about the man's feelings without it being used against him later then you're bluepilled as fuck.

In one week half of your plans can go to shit because of something the contestants do.\nAgree, however, there doesn't even seem to be any short-term plan or consistency in place. Let's take the whole camping thing as an example. Letty was made the \"camp captain\" or something and the producers told that while they are \"camping\" everybody else needs to ask Letty's permission to do anything, the stuff must be rationed, etc. However, nobody gave a shit about after a short while and I don't think it was ever brought up again nor were there any repercussions for rule breaking. And the same goes for any other challenge. For example, I get what they were trying to do with the presidency thing that is currently going on, but it quickly fell into some weird Stanford Prison Experiment type thing where freeloaders basically torture the contestants. And you could see it yesterday that the fish just basically shut down when the rules were introduced and the fatty went full dictator. \n\nOverall, it's obvious Jet and Sam have very different visions for the show. Jet wants a slice of life type show where the emotional dynamics between the contestants is the main focus, Sam however wants a hellhouse where he can bust into the place at 6am with a weedwhacker, tear the whole place apart, and the fish have to deal with it. The end result is what we're seeing here and nobody seems to know what to do with the whole thing.",

Generally when people think of autism they're thinking of people who have very poor autism management skills and as a result they suffer all the consequences of being autistic much more severely. Someone like Chris-Chan is a great example of this. He was taught zero autism management skills growing up and the results were disastrous. He's the face of autistic people online specifically because his autism manifests so overtly and is never reigned in. \n\nYou can have someone who is just as autistic as Chris-Chan, but if they're taught from a young age how to manage their autism it can have a huge effect. So much so that the person might not even be perceived as autistic but just a bit strange. This is what's going on with Josie. She's absolutely autistic but for example she knows when to go to her room and disengage from everyone else so she doesn't get overwhelmed and have a meltdown. What's funny is Fatty actually has autism too but was never taught how to manage it. He allows himself to get completely overwhelmed by his autism and then has regular meltdowns. That doesn't happen to Josie not because she's faking her autism but because she knows how to manage it much better than Fatty.",

Unless he's just acting as a middle man between customers and telling them to go get a loan from someplace. And getting a small cut.
