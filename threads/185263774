Vance just got in a bad position and slipped from one of the pushes. \n\nOf course if he went full force and just slammed her down he could have won, but he said repeatedly he wouldn't do that out of honor and he didn't. I respect him for that. \n\nHe even said afterwards in his room there are some things more important than money. He's really a good guy and I think Josie is really a good girl. That's why they'd make the best finalists. Meanwhile Letty is just sitting there not participating throwing shit on them and taping weights to Vance. Sure it's epic style content but it's a lot less interesting than two honorable enduring warriors with respect for one another going at it.\n\nThat and the fact they actually like each other makes it an interesting dynamic, whereas Josie and Vance both dislike Letty.",
