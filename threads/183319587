They're either going to have to hire someone to blaze through a total rebuild in less than a week at great expense or power through with their fucked site. No telling which would be more expensive, but neither is worth it. \n\nSomeone who isn't Jet would just cut bait and put it on bitchute (and leverage a creator streaming deal out of this massive fuckup.) put the 6 actual cameras on one stream and have Jet or someone less hated interact with chat and relay their kind words to the contestants.",

The number of viewers doesn't dictate the quality, only the amount of action that's being recorded does. So if there's a still image being recorded, the bitrate should go really low, and if not, it will increase. It has nothing to do with how many people are watching, although disabling cameras of rooms that are empty would be a good way to save bandwidth too.",

Earlier in the second century, the churches around the Mediterranean had tended to push Paul into the background (partly because he was a favorite of the Gnostics) and to exalt Peter. Marcion came to Rome and, it is said, aspired to become bishop there. His radically novel preaching, however, led to his excommunication in the year 144. He returned to the eastern Mediterranean, where his version of Christianity had a considerable following for several centuries. Mesopotamia-East Syria, the same region in which the Thomas traditions started, was one area where Marcionism took hold.\n\nYou have no idea how right you are.",
