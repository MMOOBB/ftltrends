The joke in like 50% of MDE's skits is that they hire wannabe actors and just bombard them with off-script shit to try and break them. The closest thing to an actor was Simmons cause he was an improv faggot. Damiel is a \"plant\" in that he can't get kicked out for breaking rules and he's one of the team, but he's only there to start shit and get mad. Not \"act\" or recite lines or do storylines or anything. He's just an irritable bum.",

Put a bunch of them in an enclosed house together and harass them into sperging out? Easy bux, right?\n\nOnly problem is they're the most boring, passive, reclusive spectators possible in real life, so all they do is talk, isolate, and disengage. This is what happens when an amateur thinks he has a good idea but he actually doesn't. There's a reason the Road Rules and other reality television shows never went for this in like 30 years of existence. They found out very quickly that the spergs and autists got the worst ratings and were the most boring on the show, so they always hired the extroverts and karens. Instant fireworks.\n\nIf Sam was expecting these timid terminally online autists to actually have big confrontations with each other over anything, he's powerfully retarded.",

There are dozens of better philosophers with ideas that you can actually use.\n\nAlthough if you really want to be a downer, all philosophical discourse is useless. Especially when nobody will engage in any critical/outside thinking that might make you uncomfortable. \n>>184263582\nThis anon is also right. Start with the Greeks. If you really don't want to, at minimum Plato's Republic is a mandatory read. Almost all philosophers will reference that book at some point. \n\nAnd if that's too hard and you REALLLY want to be a zoomer, The Pervert's Guide to Ideology by Zizek is a good movie that goes over ideology and how it works in a fun way by comparing it to famous movies. You don't need to fully agree with Zizek, but he's fun to watch.",

However, it is important to note that not all belief systems are considered religions. Some may be considered philosophies or worldviews.\n\nRegarding esoteric and exoteric religions, it is true that some religions have a tendency to be more esoteric or hidden, while others are more exoteric or outwardly visible. This can be due to various factors, including historical persecution or a desire to keep certain knowledge or practices limited to a select few.\n\nIt is also true that in certain historical contexts, those who held beliefs outside of the established, lawful faith were often condemned and punished. In some cases, individuals may have practiced esoteric beliefs alongside an exoteric profession of a more widely accepted religion as a form of protection. However, it is important to note that this is not necessarily the case for all esoteric practitioners throughout history.\n\nIt is important to approach religious and belief systems with an open mind and respect for diversity, recognizing that individuals have the right to hold and practice their own beliefs within legal and ethical boundaries.",
