Jon needs a nemesis though, someone to argue with so that's Letty staying around too.\nI say Josie because the stream legit lost 1k viewers when people thought she had been kicked (she was asleep in the closest) when her bed had been taken and wasn't on camera. People kept dipping in, asking \"Where Josie\" and then stream lost another 100 viewers when people bait said she had left. \nJon gives something to watch, without him there is no show, Vance is fucking boring, Damiel sleeps all day although he is getting slightly better I don't want him around on principle of being a fucking awful Plant.",
