Sam, Jet, and his crew are not bad people even though they put on this schizo edge upfront tough act, it takes an actual psychopath to genuinely want to hurt someone and not feel any remorse afterwards. Just look at how Sam went up knocking on Jons door. Like a father feeling bad he scolded his son too much, and now must apologize. \n\nThey aren't McKamey Mamor where they will humiliate, beat, and gross them out to the point of vomiting. They're just some guys. And at this point, they should just restructure the show where it's like a live stream version of Friends tv show.",

Its why you can't use phone calls as evidence in 2 party consent states, but you can use voicemails or text. A phone call is \"on-the-spot\" while a voicemail or text is deliberate.\n\nYou could probably argue the same thing with this. Tense situation, cameras 24/7, trying to calm everyone down. If they had stuck a camera in jet's face while he said that, it might be a different story, because then it could be considered planned and deliberate.",

Sam never called him a pedo or anything explicit, and anything the contestants say is... well theyre cut off from reality so anything they say is inherently speculative and therefore something \"official\" said on behalf of the show. So anything they say is irrelevant\n\nAnd yeah exactly, the candid, off the cuffs nature of what jet said, kinda lessens it a lot. But... he shouldnt have used that word, that was unwise.

TTS teasing it all day and Sam making a massive, stressful show of it probably spooked them a lot, to their knowledge, he could've been a convicted pedophile.\nThe second is that the show is a product for Sam and co to make money with, you might think that's cringe but if you want to not lose your money then you should make sure that your contestants are content enough to stay on the show, otherwise there is no show.\n\nAnyone that expected 24/7 psychological torture in had wild expectations.",
