                "comment": "I'm not saying Simmons is not a freak or that he's not guilty of anything, but there are things to consider.\nHe's a Chinese autist who doesn't understand the culture he's living in or the social cues. He explained that English is not his first language and that when he wrote his books he still wasn't that advanced. It's really not that far fetched to say that what he says is true.\nEvery time someone asked him an ironic question or made an ironic remark he had to take time to think and then literally tell them that it is indeed ironic. That alone makes it likely he's very much autistic. The idea that he had to \"check\" what is funny or not, instead of just understanding it would fit that too.\nThe video of a child in itself is not sexualised. It's just a kid wearing big trousers and laughing. It's the tags that are suspect, but his explanation, that he copied the tags, is not that far fetched if he is indeed autistic and English is his second language.\nThis is all further corroborated by how he acted throughout the show. For instance, if you watched his team's preparations for their comedic sketch, it was clear Simmons was completely lost in regards to what's potentially amusing and he had a very hard time wrapping his head around the idea of \"pretending to do something you wouldn't normally do in order to be funny.\"\nYou'd think that after what happened with Chris Chan people would be a little more knowledgeable about what autistic people can be like. Obviously Simmons is not such an extreme case, but he's still not like your \"regular\" person.",

In other words - it's a measure of how many season pass holders there are.\n\nTimezones are a thing, so roughly double it for total season passes. At $40 a pop that's ~$256k\n\nThen you've got that frank hassle progress bar, explicitly as a season pass goal. 28% at ~$256k? Sounds a lot like it's configured to hit 100% at $1mil in season pass sales.\n\nAll in all we now have a way of measuring a decent chunk of the paypigging and can estimate whether this show is breaking even or not.",

During the idubbbz interview he was asked if he will drop the act for his fans and he responded asking why would he do that when he is an entertainer and has to make content and not become lazy like others (implying people like Ian or h3h3 who became complacent and preachy).\n\nBut now you have fucking Fishtank where he dropped the act 3 days in and no one cares about anything anymore. Challenges don't mean shit, every rule in the promo/ad was broken and the contestants are given their phones the moment anything slightly inconvenient happens.\n\nEntire thing screams that they did not plan anything at all and really anyone could run this better than a bunch of retarded zoomers like Jet or Damiel.\n\nMan, what a disappointment.",

Because at that point if you knew, and did nothing you would 100% be liable. Even if Simmons isn't actually a creep (he is, he just isnt a pedo) you still have to make a choice with the info you have at hand.\nA court case would go nowhere because the chat/twitter was the libel party in any defamation, and everyone else is just parroting it.",

Look man, if he wasn't on only coffee and meat for 10 days straight I wouldn't be as worried and probably be like the other \"just hangover lol\"-anons in this thread, but that's not the case.

                "comment": ">>183757635\nThe summer camp Simmons worked at only accepted ages 7-15. I think the only really damning evidence is when he discussed what to do when a camper has a crush on you. Point 3 warns that doing anything with that camper would be the biggest mistake of your life. There's also talk of waiting till they're 18 and checking local laws \"if you really love them\". Why would you feel the need to mention any of this unless YOU had considered fucking one of those campers before and mentally ran through the ramifications? Not to mention that high schoolers rarely go to summer camp, so any camper referenced would most likely be 13 or under. Furthermore, when he was confronted on any this on the discord town hall and on the show his only excuses were that he doesn't remember or that he's an ESL. I think most of the other pieces of evidence are taken out of context or just suspect at best, but this one hasn't really ever had a good explanation.\n\nAs for Sam, Marky was 16 and already a known e-thot. 16 is legal in Rhode Island. This only happened once. How can we know? Because literally any other allegation to come forward would have been massively propelled by the obsessive discord trannies. Is the whole situation weird and in a murky area of morality? Absolutely. Does it make him a pedophile? No.\n\nThe way Sam handled the situation on the show was not ideal (although genuinely hilarious), but all of these talking points against Simmons had already surfaced. Even if Sam said absolutely nothing, TTS would have obliterated Simmons, and he still would have the same damage to his public perception on leaving the show.",

For people with ADHD (which is like all zoomers), stimulation is the same as entertainment. You play loud noises and flash bright lights at them and they laugh uncontrollably like retards.\n\nAnyway they are dogpiling on Simmons because the excitement of last night worked them up and they are having fun.",
