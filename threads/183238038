Most of the cameras have nothing on them 90% of the time, and I don't see this project having more than 1000 concurrent viewers after a week if it's as low energy and desolate as it's been so far. Either way, video streaming to thousands of people is incredibly expensive, and it's a shame Sam is wasting resources on putting this shit on the airwaves.",

The contestants themselves and their interactions which is the fun part are just failing to provide excitement. The most interactive guy so far is Jon the actual lisping autist. Not to mention the host is failing to do anything interesting or set up cool events, and the whole concept of the \"edgy hell house\" which the whole show was set up on is gone, you can't even do TTS.
