No one seems to care except for like 1 or 2 trolls leaving comments, and I'm sure they'll give up in a few weeks. I don't think Fish Tank had any sort of real effect or influence over him. Everyone was talking about how he was going to team up with Hasan to sue Sam. That shit is not happening. He's already moved on and Sam's enemies just don't really care. Fish Tank must just seem like some weird fever dream to him. He was only there for 1 week out of his life. He got bullied pretty hard but he seems quite thick headed. He has to be because he sucks ass at singing but makes singing advice content all day long. He's a true blue vaccinated fluoridated NPC.\n\nWhich makes me somewhat concerned about some of the other fishes. I think the more weird and online you are the more susceptible you are to online psychic damage. I think you could be mind broken by internet comments much easier and carry the scars away with you for the rest of your life.\n\nSimon will probably have the same experience as Simmons. He's going to go back to his middling stand up career and internet radio show and Fish Tank will have zero influence over his life, good or bad. He might actually get a very minor bump because his standup is genuinely good unlike Simmons and his singing. \n\nWhich leaves the question, who actually could see a real boost as a result of Fish Tank? I want to say Jon but honestly he's kind of retarded and his content just isn't that entertaining on his own. I think he's almost guaranteed to fade into obscurity unless he comes back for Season 2 or something. I feel like S2 or S3 could have real star making potential if the show goes way more mainstream but it feels like if you wanted to gain anything from going on S1 you would need to already be an extremely niche online micro celeb. Which means Fatty may literally have his career resurrected by the show which would be kino.",

That could mean she just doesn't like vtubers specifically but I feel like there's a high chance she simply doesn't engage with streamers or friendship simulators period. The thing about streaming is you have to be genuinely passionate about it. It's no different than having a 9 to 5 you still have to wake up every day and go to work. Except your work is being social, it seems like hell for the type of autist Josie is. \n\nShe also seems to have zero interest in sexualizing herself which won't help at all for a female streamer. She honestly might have more sucess as some type of fashion influencer especially if she could leverage her being native but when asked about that she said she doesn't even know what tribe she is and would ignore her grandma when she would tell her about it. So I don't think she's really cut out to be the type of SJW diversity influencer that brands clamour over to hire.\n\nHate to say it but Josie's ability to leverage her fame from the show comes entirely down to her own ambitions which seem extremely low. The person who said she might just take art commissions and live super cheaply is possibly bang on.",

Te incompetence was all planned, gaslighting him into believing he's fucking it all up and wasting Sam's money. They're filming Jets very own confessionals in the guise of \"behind the scenes\" footage. Can't wait to see how he reacts to the fake Simmons lawsuit arc.",
