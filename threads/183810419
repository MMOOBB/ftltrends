I would totally have sex with you, both sitting down and standing up.\" when all he really wants to do is hit Jonathon with a bat. Like seriously imagine having to be Vance and not only sit in that chair while Simmons flaunts his disgusting body in front of you, Litty's slutty dress barely concealing his raging erection and emaciated body, and just sit there, joke after joke, minute after minute, while he perfected that sissy voice. Not only having to tolerate his monstrous fucking visage but his haughty attitude as everyone on in the tank tells him he's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, SIMONE LOOKS LIKE THAT?? because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch his ugly fucking mongoloid face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been doing fucking nothing but sitting and standing and later practice swinging for your FISHTANK CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Washington. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the cum leaking out of his swollen sissy cock as he tucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get win money to sit there and revel in his \"improv (for that is what he calls it)\" skills, the skills he worked so hard for with Litty in the previous days. And then Litty calls for another circumcision joke, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the sharks could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Vance. You're not going to lose your $10,000 over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.",

Simmons was and is innocent.\nWhile it is certainly possible the marky shit happened, there's not substantial enough evidence that it did. If anything Jet's involvement in Worldcorp is far more tangible in terms of something having to do with pedophilia, and even so there is debate on whether or not the videos were actual cp or just shitty home videos.\n\nThink twice before listening to a markyposter",

Bringing him back was probably the first big fuckup, vetting in general was clearly done by a brainless xanned out wigger most of these people arent cut out for this shit so you get these lame challenges like this shit rn. Sylvia, jon, josie and damniel shouldnt have made the cut, plant idea was too much for this entry level shit they have no idea what they wanted to do or just threw a bunch of shit at the wall to see what sticks. No point in TTS when half of them would cry and leave if you really let people go in on them. \n\nThe only fuckup i think was fine was simmons and mauro, that was just shit luck imo.

She's weird and the audience likes her; having her hang out in the background before you pressure her a few weeks in and, if it happens, she caves, works well enough. Letty is ultimately the perfect contestant: a low self-esteem girl with BPD who knows how to fuck with people. Jon is close but he's too retarded. I get the appeal of getting a bunch of autistic people together and fucking with them, but this has proven, as anyone could have guessed, that it doesn't work. Forget six weeks, they're so fragile they won't last one, and they didn't, especially because the producers are soft and Sam is a scared little fag.",

Without evidence you can't really just call the guy a pedophile or groomer, that's dumb. Obviously the contestants still think he was a groomer because of how it all went down and they probably don't have much more info\n\nAt most it can be called creepy maybe, and it definitely was creepy upon hearing it at first and still seems quite creepy, mainly the camp counselor relations aspect for me I find strange to even really be talking about it. I think the complicated bit is that Simmons is clearly a confused guy so how much creepiness is just him fumbling words how much is his honest thoughts, hard to tell. I think they all just want to move on because it's a messy subject",

Sam & Jet probably seem it as a liability in some form, or maybe even more cynically they thought; if this guy is a pedo then it will hurt our brand image to keep him in there and keep him associating with us. Hard to know their actual internal reasoning, I don't bother looking at twitter so they probably had a lot of influence yeah. It does look real fucking stupid now in hindsight though",

In the full video, he's saying that campers are allowed to kiss, but anything more will break camp rules. The next day Sam gives them the baby challenge, which was obviously designed to set up an awkward situation with Simmons caring for a child. Before the challenge, Sam posted a tweet saying that Simmons will love it. Once you see the whole picture, you realise Sam was scheming and plotting how to make the situation as fucked up as possible and do everything in his power to create an image that Simmons really was a pedo. He also shouted at Simmon's and said \"BYE Simmons BYE\" and called him a nigger. The chain of events make Sam look unhinged and vindictive.",

This is my window into the lives of American youth. The only shared cultural touchstones appear to be Andrew Tate, Red Scare, Nirvana, and maybe some cartoons (I missed some of the references), but these come up rarely. One of the young men was reading a Halo novelization, another drew from a bundle of manga, and I believe I glimpsed a copy of Industrial Society and Its Future. They were excited by the opportunity to have fan fiction printed off for them (Twilight, Harry Potter, properties from a decade or more ago!). Their language is inflected by internet slang, but it's drawn from another internet than the one I use. Often, their interactions with each other betray, I think, thorough indoctrination with the modes of therapy and self-help. Maybe a lot is going over my head. It's fascinating how they seem unmoored from time. The invasion of Iraq was explained this way: Iraq was selling oil to Russia, which angered Americans.",

(They seem younger than their years somehow, in their mid-twenties but surprisingly childlike. Few know how to cook. They sleep sixteen hours a day. To amuse themselves, they stare into space. Nice kids, though. They're generally very kind to each other.) (My other observation is that the show, perhaps because it is run by amateurs, rather than coldhearted professionals, is much more kind than I believe mainstream reality television is usually. The concept was more cruel than anyone had the heart to follow through on. It is occasionally quite wholesome, with producers dispensing heartfelt advice or telling bedtime stories. When it got too stressful, cameras were cut. [One contestant was exposed for writing books that seemed to condone molesting children at camp. His expulsion was abrupt. This revelation upset the other contestants.] [Yes, it is sometimes cruel. But not to an extent that anybody involved seems upset by.])",
