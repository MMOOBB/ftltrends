The long this goes on the more likely the contestants will want to quit. And that's not counting the text to speech coming back.\nOnce the pressure is turned up, people will leave fast. That's why Sam raised the winnings by $10,000.\nIt's crazy how someone can take such a simple concept and blow it. Also, having one of their friends be a plant for \"entertainment\" was a bad idea.\n>inb4 \"you were bullied by people like Damiel!\"\nI came to see 8 people tortured by the show, I don't need a washed up 28 year old to \"stir up drama\" or whatever their excuse was to have that try hard on.

Each thread can contain 150 images! (Wow, that's a lot!) On very large threads like these though, that limit can be reached before hitting page 10 (that's insane!!!). But it limits the enjoyability of these threads when we can post images :( \n\nIf you could simply allow a new thread when we hit the image limit, that would be great!\n\nBest Regards,\nAnon",

However, I'd like to bring to your attention a concept that you might not be aware of, namely, an image limit on each thread (shocking, isn't it?). It's worth noting that each thread has the capacity to hold up to 150 images! (That's an impressive number, wouldn't you agree?) Nevertheless, on massive threads like these, that threshold may be met prior to reaching the tenth page (unbelievable!). It significantly hampers our ability to post images and detracts from the overall enjoyment of these threads :(\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could simply permit the creation of a new thread once the image limit has been reached!\n\nWarm Regards,\nAnonymous",
