I guess they were holding out hope for a good Jon replacement. There's even a petition that's garnered thousands of signatures to have the challenge changed. Obviously that wont happen but it shows how unhappy they are.",

They act like you're soul mates and would do anything for you. They even change their personality to fit in more with yours. They really make it seem like you two were the last two people on earth, and it's a heaven sent gift.\n\nThen they start to split on you. They see you as the devil, they blame you for all of their problems, and manipulate people into thinking you abused them. They often cheat on you, and monkey branch to the next relationship. They do it at a very low moment for you too. \n\nThis isn't speaking out of my ass or experience, this is a textbook clinical predictable pattern of behavior, observed over and over again.

It really looks like she's desperate to fit in with who she sees as \"the cool kid\" in the house. I just watched the first \"Josie gets a plushie video\" from April 25, and she even talks differently now to how she did 2 weeks ago, not to mention her clothing, which has gotten significantly more \"niggerish\" and baggy. Seeing her bathroom confessionals against the first week or two is honestly jarring.\nPretty sad to see. Hope she drops the wigger act, but considering she'll probably be hanging out with Damiel after this I doubt this will be going away any time soon.\nHonestly feel bad for her boyfriend if this is the case. She seems like a total 180 of the girl he was dating (DDR, going to fucking furry conventions etc) before she went into the house.\nWho knows. Maybe I'm just retarded and overthinking it, but from what I have seen of Josie's online footprint so far, this feels like an abberation and a turn for the worse.",

It's supposed to give you a numerical value, which you can then take and weigh across everything else you mentioned and decide whether or not it is worth it.\nIn other words, it's a completely useless number you threw at me and expected it to be some kind of argument winner. It's something you're continually referencing despite the fact that it is utterly irrelevant to any statements I've made. I never said \"Wow, this opportunity has worse EV than their normal jobs!\", I said a 30k prize is nothing to get excited over because it's not lifechanging money and they have low odds of winning all of it anyways. You then pointlessly said \"akshually, EV is 3750!! r u impressed by my super math of dividing by 8? im so smart, math, english major lolol\"\n\nYou're a peabrained fucking moron thinking anyone is going to be impressed by your babby's first economic term and nobody is. 30k is shit, I am correct.
