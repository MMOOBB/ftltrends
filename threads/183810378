He stayed for a while to do some pushups with Jon in that room.\nWhile the fish were in Bed 2 the crew upturned all the furniture.\nDamiel quit early on to take a shit. Jon was passed out under the bed for a couple hours then woke up and kicked a hole in the wall, which allowed the other 4 to trick him into thinking he was disqualified.\nThen the most horrible night of Letty's life happened due to constant timer alarms, baby dolls crying and Vance dominating the room with his hyper masculine 80dB snoring.\nLetty pissed in a bowl in the wardrobe twice. Sylvia was too gunshy.\nJosie and Vance have iron bladders and have slept through a lot. A couple times Letty deliberately woke Vance up to get him to stop snoring and he fell asleep snoring within ~2 minutes.\n\n>>183814431\nShe does look a bit cute right now.",

Maybe instead of getting high on pills and coke, try getting out more often and meeting new people so that you can develop real friendships, instead of relying on internet forums to give your life meaning.\nAlso, I bet your girlfriend is a crackwhore who doesn't actually love you at all. She only stays with you because she needs someone to feed her addiction. You should really reconsider your priorities and move on from that toxic relationship before it's too late.",
