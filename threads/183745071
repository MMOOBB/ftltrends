This was a straight up malicious attack against Jon. He's already not sound of mind, but the way they turned shit around on him so hard and the faggot crew treated everyone else with kid gloves was nothing short of evil.\n\nThey tortured a guy with the mind of a child. I've been a fan of Sam for almost 10 years. Fuck Sam. I've never paid a cent, nor will I ever. What a massive piece of shit. Makes me feel like shit because I've defended him for years.",

Jon has a heart of fucking gold and it pains me to see them treat him like shit. He even apologised to them, but when he gave an inch they took a mile, bastards all them including Josie.

Like seriously imagine having to be Vance and not only sit in that chair while Simmons flaunts his disgusting body in front of you, Litty's slutty dress barely concealing his raging erection and emaciated body, and just sit there, joke after joke, minute after minute, while he perfected that sissy voice. Not only having to tolerate his monstrous fucking visage but his haughty attitude as everyone on in the tank tells him he's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, SIMONE LOOKS LIKE THAT?? because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch his ugly fucking mongoloid face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been doing fucking nothing but sitting and standing and later practice swinging for your FISHTANK CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Washington. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the cum leaking out of his swollen sissy cock as he tucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get win money to sit there and revel in his \"improv (for that is what he calls it)\" skills, the skills he worked so hard for with Litty in the previous days. And then Litty calls for another circumcision joke, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the sharks could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Vance. You're not going to lose your $10,000 over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.",

Even by subreddit you find completely different ingroup culture, and as time goes on the fracturing of the site into isolated inlets has only grown. Is it a good website? Fuck no, but the fact MDE had a subreddit for years before it was banned in 2019-2020 (and still lives on in smaller splinter subs) is proof that you can't just make a black/white \"Reddit le bad and evil malicious vs 4chan le good and wholesome\" simplification, it's retarded dualism that leads to sucking your own dick about how everyone but you is an evil sadist when the biggest joke in this thread for days has been about how the show is too soft and needs to be harder",

Around 46 minutes \n>You guys already know the deal. I am sure people are upset and have shit they want to say, but there is nobody who sympathizes with these types of people who do or are into p-word stuff. \nHe also says this earlier but I forgot to timestamp it\n>I don't think anyone should interact with Simmons. Ever. In my opinion I think it's a closed book.\nThis shit is 6 hours long and he pops in and out, the entire thing though is mostly twitter zoomers shitting on Simmons the entire time in front of an audience.",
