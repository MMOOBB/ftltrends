The line is to wait until the girls are 18 or quit your job. Not only that most of those lines were stolen from other sources. Simmons is odd yes but he is a harmless ESL that got singled out by Sam for no reason. Read the damn book you love to argue about so much. Sam is the actual one in hot water considering he actually fucked an underage girl when he was 29. Why do you think the name \"Marky\" isn't even allowed on the TTS? Sam and his zoomer staff knows this. None of it matters anyway, I already reported everything to the authorities.",

Also of course pray to Jesus.\n>>183805730\nIn terms of improving life. Get a hobby that allows you to tangibly work on a skill, like wood working or gardening. Maybe hunting/fishing. Those types of things will give you stories and feelings of achievement. Also, don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Most people live very passively so don't worry too much about criticism from those types. Lastly, write what you'd like your life to look in 10 years, then 5, then 2. Then work a road map to get there.\nAlso career wise. You can get an IT certification like CCNA or the system admin certs. They provide comfy jobs and can lead you into cyber security, like a SOC analyst once you get the Security+ certification.\nMost of the IT jobs really just require experience, not CS degree. Although that is looked upon the higher up you go.",
