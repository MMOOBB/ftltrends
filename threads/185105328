                "comment": "Ultimately, the fatal flaw of fish tank was having it run concurrently with WP2, thus making Jet the lead on the project. When Sam is there, its obvious that he wants to deliver what was promised. He just sat there and laughed when Fatty had his hour long meltdown towards Sylvia. In the one on ones he eggs people on and tries to get them to be even more mischievous. But the problem is, he's seemingly hardly ever there so the day to day shit is ran/ruined by Jet who constantly interferes in drama and seemingly wants the tank to be nothing but his personal sims game. \n\nThis concept is a great idea. They've even had some great ideas within the concept. But if there's a season 2 they need a solid plan of action. Solid rules and consequences. 90% less roleplay shit. And Jet needs to never interfere unless someone is legitimately very close to being injured.",

Myself is fabricated, an aberration. I am a noncontingent Human Fish. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Fish Tank) if they ever did exist. I shake black babies to death: there are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the Uncontrollable Jon and the Insane Chris, the Vicious Hog and the Evil Hawaiian, all the coprophillic mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward sanitation, I have now surpassed. \n\n>I still, though, hold on to one single borderline truth: no one is safe from elimination challenges, no Fish Buck is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of Fish behavior must be assumed to have some simp validity. Is evil something Fish are? Or is it a bit Fish do? My UTI pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better Tank for any Fish. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on Free Loaders. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this \u2014 and I have countless times to TTS, in just about every OSHA violation I\u2019ve committed \u2014 and coming face-to-face with these fecal truths, there is no cunt-catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confessional has meant nothing \u2026\u201d",

The only thing that didn't bore me, obviously enough, was how much Fish Bucks Josie made, and yet in her stimming obviousness it did. There wasn't a clear, identifiable path to victory for me, except for greed and possibly total disgust. I had all the characteristics of a human Fish - flesh, blood, skin, hair - but my depersonalization was so intense, had gone so deep, that the normal ability to feel compassion had been eradicated, the victim of a slow, purposeful hasseling. I was simply imitating reality tv, a rough resemblance of a Stacy, with only a dim corner of my mind functioning. Something horrible was happening and yet I couldn't figure out why - I couldn't put my finger on it.\u201d",

Sylvia was a fat cunt you could easily bully and was notably no fun (not dancing with the others that one time) and therefore a character.

It was a 480p live feed so clear and real and vital to me that in its purity it was almost abstract. \n\n>This was what I could understand, this was how I lived my Fish Tank life, what I constructed my toe-walk movement around, how I dealt with the tangible. This was the geography around which my reality television being revolved: it did not occur to me, ever, that Fish were good or that a Free Loader was capable of change or that the Tank could be a better place through one\u2019s own taking pleasure in a feeling or a look or a gesture to the camera, of receiving another person\u2019s TTS or loot crates. Nothing was affirmative, the term \u201cgenerosity of American Spirits\u201d applied to nothing, was a cliche, was some kind of bad joke. \n\n>Sex is mathematics, just ask Airsoft on the PSAT section. Waifuism is no longer an issue. What does intelligence signify? Define reason. Desire- meaningless. Sharing links is not a cure. Justice is dead, Simon brwoke it. Fear, recrimination, innocence, sympathy, guilt, waste, failure, grief, were things, emotions, that no one really felt anymore. Reflection is useless, the Tank is senseless. Evil is its only permanence. God is not alive. Plushies cannot be trusted.

The players accrue Fishpoints by winning challenges throughout the season\n4. Because certain players could be mathematically eliminated at a certain point, the Fishpoints are worth actual money like Fishbucks were\n5. The value of a Fishpoint is one part of a total sum announced at the beginning of the season. If the prize pool is 100,000 dollars, and 437 Fishpoints are awarded during the season, each one would be worth 229 dollars.\n6. The viewers can also buy Fishpoints for their favorite contestant through the website (maybe even pay to subtract them from someone they hate) \n7. The winner is awarded the value of their Fishpoints plus some fixed bonus that isn't a part of the common prize pool",

I can almost guarantee Jon would've been in the tank longer if they didn't insist on doing the \"act like a retard\" shit, which was probably what really pushed him over the edge, everything else he pretty much got over. Jon was a huge part of the show, a fan favorite, and they pushed him out basically, notice how they stopped doing anything like \"act like a retard\" after he left too? if they just hadn't done that things would've gone differently.",

Apparently he got his start in reality TV as a villain on some 2012 big brother knock-off. He tried to turn it into Fishtank ten years too early by verbally harassing all the guests, making sexual remarks, calling women fat, being an Alpha against other male contestants, etc. Everyone in the house was a complete normie and obviously he hassled all of them to the point where one dude left. Alex got voted out and the 2012 television audience didn't vote to save him.",
