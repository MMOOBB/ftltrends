I'm rooting for Letty but I respect her less every day she is there enabling Sam to get off on humiliating and torturing her. I get she doesn't have anything to go back to, but I'm also guessing she is lacking care and love from her parents to subject herself to this. No person, especially a woman in her right mind, would put themselves through this. There has to be some deep seated trauma that makes someone just take abuse like this.",

Plus the two play along with bits well enough.\nLetty vs. Anyone is the Hellhouse finale, if they're gonna still stick to that concept. \n\nThough Letty looks like she's in complete shutdown mode right now so I have no idea what's gonna happen.",

Like he understood it was a show about creating content and keeping people entertained. He played into that character and did shit he would never have done in the first week But after he got completely shitfaced and tried to say Vance was setting him up or whatever his whole demeanor changed. He wasn't light hearted and fun he was sour all the time. I think he took the tts seriously when they were just trolling him and actually blamed the producers when it was just some light hearted banter they told vance to ask him about his experience with retards. And then to leave like that? Just made him look like a coward \nI know this is an essay but holy shit did he crater all the goodwill he made online. Just do the opposite of what he did if you are ever put on a show like fishtank",

It would just come across as a kinda one-sided war with a disappointing finish depending on who wins. \nHowever with Vance v Josie, there would be no real venom behind it, meaning they could both go all-out without fear of crossing a line. Just like how Vance and Lance had their \"feud\"; there was no real animosity between them, but it was still fun as shit to watch. \nThese two could easily carry a whole week by themselves with pranks and other antics if they are given properly direction by the crew, and I think people would ultimately be satisfied with either one winning at the end of it.",

                "comment": ">>185146104\nThis, as long as there are enough freeloaders to fill the dead air I think it'd be better than Letty vs anyone.\n\nLetty has produced a lot of \"content\" sure but none of it has been clever. 99% of it has been a willingness to cross lines like poo poo and pee pee. Josie and Vance do more entertaining and interesting things like playing both sides with the freeloaders earlier, eavesdropping, their talks to the camera, and they both actually try in challenges unlike Letty who mostly kinda checks out. Plus the minute Letty gets any retaliation she runs to the producers or just sulks in her room, cries, or some other shit. \n\nThat's not to say Letty hasn't gotten a lot of shit, but she has more than enough fishbucks. She doesn't need an extra 30k and frankly she hasn't earned it. If they really want to give the money to the person who survived \"hellhouse\" the most unperturbed it'd be Vance or Josie. Just look at the chaos earlier and the fact they both got their heads shaved/eyebrows shaved while Letty just sat there because she was too vain. I also think it's important you have two people who actually like each other and no one likes Letty, she's even the least popular in fan polls now. Sure there are a lot of lettycel coomers here but everywhere else there is not. Vance and Josie would be the only real kino showdown, to me. Letty versus either of them would just be I'll go pee on their stuff, make a mess, and then only half heartedly try in a challenge/larp. There's nothing there if it's Letty. She will be the next to go.",
