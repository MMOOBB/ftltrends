Mauro and Jon then almost got into a fight immediately after. Then, Simmons played a somber farewell tune on his harmonica until the moment Sam showed up.

The point of this isn\u2019t a \u2018show\u2019 in the typical sense. We want to see sincere, real reactions. Which is why people have come to liking Jon, even if he is wildly retarded. If Vance just dropped the act of being the \u2018snake\u2019 character and unironically just would b himself, both his character and the stream itself would be 100x better. You are not a woman, Vance, so stop snaking around like one.",
