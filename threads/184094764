He responded to Sylvia and Letty both saying that men should be telling their feelings and that this is what is causing the suicide wave for men.\nJon knows it's bullshit and if you show your emotions to women you will be fucked over. Jon doesn't argue what he believes the world should be and trying to change it, he just says what the world is like and how you should operate in the world that we live in.\n>i wouldn't dream of dumping my IRL problems on my wife or girlfriend\nYou'll never have any",
