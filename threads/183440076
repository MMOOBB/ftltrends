You see 1000 spiders everywhere you look regardless of who you are and you see people that seem real completely real (not like LSD or Shrooms). You are pretty much just in the shadow realm, there is never a pleasurable euphoria. Abusers talk about how its not even fun they just feel stuck suffering from it forever\n\nYou can take A LOT too, i took 600mg but fuckers will take 2000mg and either ruin their organs or just become actual schizos / permanent psych ward patients. Its easily the top of the list of DONT DO IT. Its not fun",
