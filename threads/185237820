People fail to realize how much of this obsession is just because of continued 24/7 content of her on the show and exposure to discussion full of NEETs and shills forcing conversation about it. Fishtank doesn't get much attention anymore and it never really went viral in the first place. Interest in her is going to dry up as soon as the show ends, and even she recognizes that and talked about it. Jon was everyone's favorite for the 2 weeks he was there when people still tuned in, and nobody gives a shit about him anymore.",

I swear to God, the most heavenly high is gargling that wonderboy's nutshack while going fist deep into his shitter. I had Damiel screaming in the sheets with head too ridiculous to ignore. That chigga frotted my cock until he busted on my mouth, I had to return the favor. That chigga Damiel and I been fucking non-stop ever since, but keep that shit on the DL. He does that shit for free. If you're gonna ask me how to \"long\" Damiel I'll be deadass. All you gotta do is ask, be straight up, and get physical real quick. Touch his nuts, get on ya knees, talk your shit. He doesn't play around with no pansy-ass niggas either. He likes his men manly, and his dick thick. Dark skin, 6'5 is the minimum and I ain't talking about height boy.\nThat chigga Damiel stole my heart and drank my seed.",

The harsh treatment is a cover - they've never done anything harsh enough to make her want to leave. Frank is the one time she cried and she was about to leave, and he's open about not being involved in the production of this. She was packing her bag before Sam pulled her into B4 bathroom to convince her to stay.\nShe's going to \"win\" immunity today and then they will probably send Josie home because she doesn't get TTS or plushie money anymore so they think she's been wrung dry.",
