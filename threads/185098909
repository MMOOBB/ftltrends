Like have a shark always roaming starting shit, or descalating shit if Jet thinks it might be liability. \n\nYou can argue for S2 being tame since anyone on it would know whats going on; but its a big difference between larping that you can then actually being in the shit itself; you can say you'll be unbothered but you'll be unwillingly be swept up by the bullshit.

Myself is fabricated, an aberration. I am a noncontingent Human Fish. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Fish Tank) if they ever did exist. I shake black babies to death: there are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the Uncontrollable Jon and the Insane Chris, the Vicious Hog and the Evil Hawaiian, all the coprophillic mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward sanitation, I have now surpassed. \n\n>I still, though, hold on to one single borderline truth: no one is safe from elimination challenges, no Fish Buck is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of Fish behavior must be assumed to have some simp validity. Is evil something Fish are? Or is it a bit Fish do? My UTI pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better Tank for any Fish. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on Free Loaders. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this \u2014 and I have countless times to TTS, in just about every OSHA violation I\u2019ve committed \u2014 and coming face-to-face with these fecal truths, there is no cunt-catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this.

Yeah, he's a decent person maybe, but one day I think he's gonna sexually harass some women outside of the fishtank and become a predator. Mark my words, this guy's complete lack of inhibition or social cues is dangerous and WILL end up on a registry if he makes it to his 30s.\nThe issue is that he clearly sees Sam as a father or big brother figure, but Sam is just pushing Chris to further humiliate himself. This kinda shit probably happens all the time to Chris irl cause he's a massive lolcow and never runs out of energy or willingness to humiliate himself.",
