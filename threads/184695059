Get a bunch of 4/10 autistic weirdo girls for NEET simps to fawn over and maybe include 1 Jon in the cast so they seem attainable. Everyone else on the show was a failure anyways so just cut the fat and make it a Waifu house. Would rake in way more cash that way rather than having deadweight like Sylvia/Damiel/Mauro.",

What a joyous and momentous occasion. \nAs the chairman, it is my utmost pleasure to announce on behalf of /tv/'s Official Arbitrary Numerical Dick-measuring of Success Board that the 24/7 live-streaming interactive internet show Fish Tank Live has crossed the threshold of 700 discussion threads within only 25 days of the show's commencement! This is a surefire indicator of the popularity and success of the show. \nIt is hereby ordered by official decree of /tv/'s OANDSB that all seething Discord trannies, blockheads, Jews, Tim Heidecker, Mrs. and Mr. Anisa Jomha, poorfags, manlets, and women (who don't belong on the internet anyway) shall immediately cease -- oh, wait a minute! What's this? Hmm. I see...\nI regret to inform you that the above message was given in error. I have just been handed an updated memorandum by the Board, and it appears the criteria of success for a 24/7 livestreaming interactive internet show (in the genre of heckhouse, porno, or torturearium) has been amended and has taken effect immediately prior to this announcement.\nThe ACTUAL threshold of success is NOT seven hundred (700) threads... rather, it is eight hundred (800) threads. I solemnly apologize to /ftl/, Jet Neptune, and Sam Hyde for getting your hopes up, but the show is NOT yet declared a success. In fact, as if right now, this show is an absolute garbage fire of a failure, like everything nazi pedophile Scam Hyde does.",

They need more people - a good mix of them from different backgrounds and they need to do a better job of striking a balance of grotesque and antagonistic to more likable and attractive people, but they all should be retarded and maladjusted in some way. But importantly, they need to find people who won't flake out and leave and are desperate enough to endure. Probably would be better off finding extroverts. Throw in a lolcow. And a chick with fat honkers to lure the simps. \n\nAdd more plants, better challenges, a new location - somewhere isolated with more open space.
