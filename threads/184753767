Think about it, If you hear someone having a mental breakdown in the house you'd want to check in and talk to them right? Well thats what Vance did but he saw that Sam was already having a deep convo with Chris already so he just said \"Oh, i just came to check in on him... I thought he was alone.\" and that makes perfect sense to just leave it to Sam and just leave. Vance did nothing wrong there and Sam's just being a fucking asshole there. So from Sam's point of view it was cringe, but i think from a logical point of view Vance did nothing wrong and it all made sense socially.",

Here's my predictions\n\n> Letty: Goes back to being a NEET at home with her parents. Gathers a collective army of simps on her new Discord/socials and sinks deeper into becoming even more of a narcissist. Might possibly get attacked by her psyho ex(es). Might also attempt to become an e-girl and fail.\n> Josie: Will attempt streaming when she gets out of the house. Huge initial viewer count that significantly drops off, and realises that it requires keeping an army of simps satiated, which she hates. Goes back to being a wagie and uses the $6k+ to fund her art shit. Might pick up some new gaming buddies and friends from none creepy/simp fans of Fishtank.\n> Vance: Goes back to being a delivery driver, but tries out standup or Sam Hyde style comedy. Girlfriend will 100% leave him and he'll just go back to \"yeah\"'ing at whatever job he ends up with. Will probably just go back to the way he was before the show.\n> Sylvia: Might (sadly) get back onto drugs again. Will probably end up just doing OnlyFans shit as a career if her music completely fails. Will probably just go back to the way she was before.",

Sam is supposedly all level headed and business minded now, but this shows he clearly has a propensity for career suicide still coursing through his veins. If you don't think shit like that can you in jail you need to snap out of it, because it won't be long before you're getting raped in one. \n\nFrank was mad anxious afterward with Lance saying typical \"pre-ramifications\" shit like \"I barely touched her.\" The reason Sam and Jet mentioned \"shitting\" is because if they say \"manhandling the female guests\" then they just admitted to being complicit in Frank's behavior. I guarantee you they are talking to loads of lawyers and professionals behind the scenes over that shit. If you think you can get away scott free for something like that you are living in a different universe. Use your brain. It's not about what you like or dislike, it's about real life and what happens in real life when you do certain things. The whole thing about being picked up by another company was also a way of saying \"we won't be having any more of that\" without appearing soft to the more hardcore fans.",

Vance\nHe's the only one who would use the money responsibly but he's also sort of boring because he's obviously just trying to survive and lay as low as possible to get there. I feel like the closer he gets to the finish line he'll probably become a lot more entertaining.\n>4. Sylvia\nDisgusting pig with no redeeming qualities. Hypocrite. Whiny bitch. \n\nFreeloaders\n>1.

Simon\nWhen he was active he was really funny, he broke the fish tank, and his rules actually brought about some entertainment and drama to the tank\n>3. Lance\nJust because I find his schtick amusing\n>4. Frank \nI feel like he didn't really do anything at all. Letty and Chris cause more chaos and destruction than he did.
