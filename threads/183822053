Jet and the crew, being the drug-addled zoomer wiggers they are, also find this sort of shit entertaining and have completely abandoned the original premise show for it.",

The bedframe replicated a jail, which insinuates Simmons belongs in jail. It seemed very random at the time, but in hindsight it makes a lot more sense. The baby challenge was also planned to make Simmons look more like a pedo.",

Vance, Letty & Josie then agreed they'd split the fishbucks but Vance said he would be the last to leave and receive the fishbucks and then give them their share, and if they didn't like that he said he was fine to stay in the cell for another day. He was sleeping pretty well compared to the others so he seemed serious.\nThey all shook on it, Josie walked out then Letty stayed and started saying how she didn't trust Vance and tried to change the deal.\nIt was hard to hear but I Vance said he was just going to stay, then Letty realised it was over and left.\n\nIf Vance gets 3 fish bucks we'll see if he shares them. I think Letty broke the deal but maybe he should give 1 to Josie.\n\nNo I sleep, for I am an ausfag. I'd appreciate a detailed rundown when I wake in 8 hours.",

They were basically the onl ytwo contestants to reall yget into Jon's face about all his bullshit from the first week (or were you even watching?) Also, the audience revealed how gullible they are after hating Jon and loving to see him abused (rightfully so), to making him out to be some sort of sympathetic protagonist once the staff told them Jon has had it rough and to stop bullying him.\n>B-but I thought this is hellhouse guys?! We have to HARDER on the contestants, right Joker??? OH WAIT - Jon cried? Can't be too hard on the retard...\n\nThe inconsistency from the producers and the audience has been detrimental to the show. And even worse, Sam pulled his stunt with Simmons just as the participants were starting to create great content on their own. Yes, everyone wanted Sam and the audience to fuck with them relentlessly, but I think everyone was surprised how much great material they were putting out on their own after a few days. And then Simmons-gate happened and here we are - everyone locked in a room for a day with nothing going on. \nOh wait, Jon got the microphone and read from the Bible. As if we haven't had to hear his loud ass voice enough over the last ten days. If you still think his voice is funny, I don't know what to say.",
