My friend is way older then Josie and nowhere near as cringy or angsty but it's almost 1 to 1 exactly the same things my friend has cried to me about.\n\nI feel very bad for Josie now.",

No one knows how to treat the game because the rules and regulations are constantly being shifted around. And this really hit a breaking point with the Simmons shit, considering there is yet to be a true \u201celimination\u201d on the show. And yeah, I get it - the nebulous aspect of the show is part of its appeal. But we\u2019re seeing in real-time how that\u2019s working out: the contestants and audience start to care less and less because they realize there\u2019s no point. If they try and make some plan or strategy, it will just be rendered meaningless tomorrow. Or maybe they\u2019ll be sent home for some random reason. So why try too hard at all? Why become too invested at all? I think someone in these threads said it best in pointing out the show could actually benefit from more structure. The contestants and audience should have some idea when the daily challenges are. There should be schedule for bigger events like meeting and eliminations. Really, no one should be sent home unless they quit. The game should revolve around fucking with the contestants and daily challenges for them to collect fish bucks. Have ways that contestants are able to steal fish bucks from each other and that sort of thing. Whoever had the most at the end wins the big prize, but everyone else can cash in their winnings for a smaller percentage to keep them motivated to stay. There was just a great dynamic between everyone before the Simmons fiasco. Even Simmons was a standout character, for better or worse. We had friendships, feuds, goods times and arguments. The contestants were organically producing a lot of great content even when Sam wasn\u2019t around. These last few days have been so dull.",

He probably was due to be kicked off anyway. \nMy only issue is that Sam can't act all high and mighty. He can pretend to be for a reason to yell at a guy because it's funny, but many of his fans are taking it more seriously, which is annoying. \nMost fans don't know anything about the Marky stuff because Sam protects them from it, and at this point many would probably turn around and say it's based when Sam does it, but the quotes from Simmons book out of context mean he's a pedo whose life should be fucked with. \nSam is funny, but he certainly attracted this edgy young audience lacking in self awareness and looking for a father figure who can do no wrong.\nSam's no angel, but I like his content. He can yell at Simmons and kick him off because he's funny, but he's not purer than Simmons in the field of grooming.",

He should've built mystique, said he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to talk about, act like he had strong emotions about it. You need to get their attention.\nOnce the story begins, you need to tell it thru questions. So you don't say \"I was the baby in Teletubbies,\" you say, \"Do you guys know the show Teletubbies? Do you know the sun?\" You get them to tell part of the story. It gets them involved. \nFinally you need a snappy punchline, something on the level of Scat Scout that'll get repeated.",
