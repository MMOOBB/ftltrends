It would be very cool to see a villainous Letty arc to finally justify getting rid of her, or a Letty redemption arc to finally justify giving her the win despite Josie being the scripted winner.\nWon't happen. Tomorrow Hassle will harass Letty and Letty will call him out on breaking their alliance and he'll say some weasely shit like \"we didn't agree I couldn't do THIS.\" Then a TTS will come thru and say, \"hey Advil junkie, why don't you fuck with Josie for once,\" and he'll run downstairs and complain to Jet and them come up and fart in Josie's room once and Josiecels will cheer about how Josie claims she can't smell for an entire half of a thread.",

I actually thought she was the plant for the longest time and the only reason I think she ISN'T the plant is because the producers would be too retarded to pull that off. One of my favorite Letty moments is when she brought up Simmons book to Goldstriker way before the TTS came back up and he said, \"How do you know about that,\" and her room searched for a phone. \nShe's very perceptive and has a good memory. I was also impressed when she called out Hassle for sniffing her feet by bringing up him accusing Sylvia of sexual harassment to get her off his case.",

The whole ella's secret mission was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The mission was not unique in that it was one of the hundred theyve come up with for Letty to be fucked with. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see Letty leave. She was the obvious choice considering the total delusion of the viewers and their unwarranted hatrid of her. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, ellie has been pretty diligent in being agressive to letty and telling everyone she was a plant set there to knock her out, yet when she spent the night in her room she fell into Letty's spiderweb of manipulation within an hour. She left the sexual tension exactly where Letty built it for hours while she asked what her type was and flirted with her. When Sam asked her to work on her mission, she did nothing and just cried in her room because of the cognitive dissonance she was feeling. Now, whether or not Letty knew from the get-go that she was there to fuck with her, it's obvious that she was privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that Ellen perceived that letty was some evil witch because she only watched the show on twitter with her fellow troons and thought she could handle her, but letty was nothing but nice and flirty with her, and she couldnt bring herself to do it. She did the only thing she could do, not even try, thus denying Sam the pleasure of watching letty leave while simultaneously fooling the the chat into thinking that she was just weak and couldnt havdle it. This shit even had herself wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Eli is THE only truly boring character on this piece of shit show. Letty has been watching everything, talked with Elenora in person for a while, and already clocked her, seduced her, and forced her into the her Cutegirl Harem. She truly is the cuckqueen of the realm.",

If there were at least 3 Letties to form a mean girl clique, Josie wouldn't have made it far. Girls are crazy. \nThe tank is a limiting factor for mean girl Letty with everyone on to her, but Letty carries on. \nThe tank definitely limits Sylvia though. In the wild Sylvia would counter Letty by beating the shit out of her, that's why she's unused to strategy and drinks to cope with emotion.",

I'm not terribly sympathetic because the idea of doing a show like this to begin with reflects a major lack of dignity and self-respect, but I'm not a sadist so I don't enjoy other's misery for it's own sake. These aren't particularly reprehensible people, they're just your average dopes. Hopefully the Season 2 sex offender house comes to fruition.
