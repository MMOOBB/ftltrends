Paying a production company to do all the work for him? Renting an already prepared arena so that he doesn't have to bother with setting anything up?

I've seen what Ian was doing pre-youtube, he was a little spergy dork who went to cartoon conventions with his mom. Even if you put aside his past and solely look at his relationship it's blatantly obvious. There is no possible way that a man who's dated before would marry a controlling, tatted-up, bitchy titty-streamer. That's the kind of poor decision making that comes from getting your first nut off and deciding you want to be with that first girl forever. He's in that phase most guys enter with their highschool gf, only he's doing it now in adulthood because of the late start so the consequences of it will be a lot more severe than looking back and cringing. \n>you underestimate the blue pill mentality. When you imagine women as equal and having agency you let them get away with so much.\nIt has little to do with mentality. Experience with women would tell you, even unconsciously, that you do not propose to a creature like that. His infatuation with that girl comes from a lack of experience, not a philosophical outlook.\n>unless an old friend takes him under his wing and trains him for CC3. Maybe someone no one expects, maybe even someone thought to be an adversary.\nSam is never going to train Ian. It's just not going to happen, Sam would have to be a mongoloid, troglodyte retard to extend a helping hand to Ian after all the shit Ian pulled on him and his latest amphibian protege.",

I've seen what Ian was doing pre-youtube, he was a little spergy dork who went to cartoon conventions with his mom. Even if you put aside his past and solely look at his relationship it's blatantly obvious. There is no possible way that a man who's dated before would marry a controlling, tatted-up, bitchy titty-streamer. That's the kind of poor decision making that comes from getting your first nut off and deciding you want to be with that first girl forever.\nas a former blue pilled lefty, its hard to understand the mindset since it's so obviously at odds with reality. Blue pilled dudes don't care about controlling women, they think it makes them progressive, they're sex positive so it doesn't matter that she's a whore, I personally hate tattoos but clearly he likes them. I understand what you're saying, and I'm not saying you're wrong, but the blue pilled mindset alone can result in you thinking a woman like Anisa is wife material. Its just so many lies built on top of lies. \n>Experience with women would tell you, even unconsciously, that you do not propose to a creature like that. \ncorrect. Experience is naturally red pilling particularly about women. I suppose we're arguing two sides of the same coin, you pointing to inexperience and me pointing to a mindset that almost requires inexperience as a prerequisite. \n>His infatuation with that girl comes from a lack of experience, not a philosophical outlook.\nyeah I suppose you're right. They've even talked about how Ian has said, \"i'll never get another girl like you if we break up.\" \n>Sam is never going to train Ian. \nIan has too much pride but it would be the redemption arc for iDubbz \n> It's just not going to happen, Sam would have to be a mongoloid, troglodyte retard to extend a helping hand to Ian after all the shit Ian pulled on him and his latest amphibian protege.\nI think he'd do it.

He was down extremely bad and even most of his fans were saying he should pack it in. Jet and the zoomers joined up during the WORST MDE arc and had to stick around for years getting paid nothing before things got good again. Sam basically owes an eternal debt of gratitude to them for holding the camera and starring in his extremely shit gumroad skits when no one else would. The only reason MDE even still exists today is because Jet and the zoomers carried it long enough for Sam to put some W's back up on the board.\n\nSo it always blows my mind when people think they somehow ruined MDE, there wouldn't be any post-WP MDE without them. Sam fucking knows this and that's why he sticks by them.",

If he left tomorrow you think Nick would have the gumption to get up and do house streams himself? get fucking real.\n\ni don't think ANY of the zoomers are funny or have any charisma or talent whatsoever but complaining about them at this point is so fucking stupid. they run 80% of MDE at this point. complaining about Jets involvement in fish tank is ESPECIALLY fucking retarded because it was his idea, it's his production, he's in charge of it, Sam is just executive producing it.\n\nYou are watching JETS SHOW right now, not fucking Sam's.
