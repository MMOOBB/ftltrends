Look at how much he took the bait on Ben's storytime and Jet played it up to act as if they were fighting. Now they'll just use that to fuck with him more, the rest know its a big joke and they just get abused, but Jon can't be abused by TTS because he's specifically asked for no mean TTS and they cater to him because he's a sperg. They can manipulate him the easiest so it makes the show more entertaining.\n\nThats why Sam is nice to him, because he's a Tate fan and globs onto any father figure/mentor and will do anything he says like a lap dog.\n\n>>183924896\nHe's literally doing that with Vance right now, and Jon kicks up a stink anytime things don't go his way and nobody wants to deal with it because he doesn't take no for an answer.\n\nI don't know how everyone doesn't see this.

That's about all I can remember when it comes to betraying Jons trust in part of Letty. Apart from that, she's been quite honest with Jon and even defending him when Vance had talked shit about Jon. I kind of get the feeling that not only the contestants want her out, but the production team as well. They must've not taken well with her leaks and allegedly being a bpd thot who has ruined a few of her ex's lives. She's been singled out quite heavy today in many ways more than just being called a harlot etc. by TTS. Not for or against her but it does seem to me like this will end similarly to the Simmons event with her being not just voted out, but slandered for her past.",

Jon is disliked sure, but everyone trust him because he's a genuine gold hearted pure retard boy that would never betray another fish nor seek to drive them out, until we saw tonight that is with him and his mastermind plan of giving genuine info to Vance that Letty whispered to him that he could use to make sure she is purposely targeted against during elimination challenges by the rest of the group. He can continue to use Jon to take out hog also with Damiel having a gay bro boner for him too. Hog is also warming of to Jon with his performance with Ben having everyone else in complete awe of him.\nThe pieces are literally also on the chessboard for him, and Jon is his Queen piece.\nThere is no reason why final 3 shouldn't be Jon, Vance, and Josie, unless Vance fucks up by continuing of plan of kicking Jon after Letty",

She tried to vent and get some support from Jon but even he just straight up ratted her out. I feel bad for Letty, she's not perfect but she absolutely didn't fucking start the gossiping witch hunt bullshit. \n\nTo put salt on the wound she was the 1 and only person that always ran to support Jon even when Daniel was bullying him on the early days. She was the real one out of all them.\n\nYou fags are buying into fake news and false narratives.",

Even his own faith is performative, can't you see he's an act he's doing this to play the game and win favours by acting on his superiority complex lets not forget after his mild argument with Simmons and he had a tantrum he was telling him how he believes he's the chosen one to save the world and rise people up.\nHe's inconsiderate, doesn't clean up after himself and is only taking Ben seriously because he's a gullible moron who believes everything even when Vance is directly lying to him yet he'll shit talk Letty even though ironically she's protected him (probably for her own gain) \n\nDon't fall for his schtick.
