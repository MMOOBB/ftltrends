I guess they were holding out hope for a good Jon replacement. There's even a petition that's garnered thousands of signatures to have the challenge changed. Obviously that wont happen but it shows how unhappy they are.",

This act however has the interesting effect of signaling attainability to incels who thinks an autistic, outcast girlfriend is someone who would potentially accept their broken selves as a partner. Which, we all know isn't true, but this is what they keep telling themselves. In reality though, Josie has a vast selection of dudes to pick from and she will and has fucked some of them. Josiecells aren't unique, there's lots of guys who fall for her act. That's the whole point of the act. \n \nShe pretends to be shy and the shy girl effect offers a blank canvas that men can project desirable traits on. Since she doesn't display a real personality, you can fool yourself that her personality is whatever you want it to be. Josie could be perceived as being friendly and kind and caring; even though her real personality, that you barely know anything about, could be the complete opposite. \n \nAll of these illusions will fall apart eventually. She will probably reveal she's fucked tons of guys. She'll start forgetting about her autism act and will start toning down her so-called stimming because she can't keep it up 24/7. She will be letting parts of her personality shine through and it will be fundamentally gross, like the discovery that she's a wannabe nigger and a bully and an attention whore. \n \nAnd as much as Josiecells love her now they will feel betrayed and start hating her when their delusions fall apart. She's just a vapid attention whoring zoomer who tries way too hard to be a TikTok meme, but incels will demonize the same way they formerly idolized her. Why? Because what she shrewdly offered them, was a hope that she was someone who could accept them for who they are. But it was all a lie. And Josie wasn't real. Josie was a predator. And she preys on incels.",

One of the greatest assets an aspie could have is not excusing people's actions or condoning them, even if they are friends/family/people they like.
