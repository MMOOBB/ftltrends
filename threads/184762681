In introducing Frank (who I believe has a criminal record- talk about a 'liability', Sam!) and allowing him to assault Letty (they did not immediately remove Frank for several hours), fishtank is vicariously liable for Frank's actions and any harm suffered to Letty\nIn fishtank's defence, Letty did not leave the fishtank immediately or try to remove herself from the situation so it could be argued that this is all part of the show and she actually did consent to all of this happening\nultimately this is the kind of case which would be settled with a fat payment made to Letty before it even reached court",

In both times it's clear that Letty didn't consent to any of that\nJet and the team are very lucky that nobody has gotten sick from all the bodily fluids being thrown around and that no-one has tripped and hurt themselves on all the shit lying around the house all the time because they would absolutely be liable for any harm that came from that",
