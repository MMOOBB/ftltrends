Nitice how nobody really gave a shit aside from Jose who seems to have a bizarre sentimentality towards the chigger for some reason. I'll be honest though, for all his niggerisms, I'm kind of going to miss Damiel's random chimpouts. He was the biggest resistance Letty had after Jon and the only person who could upset her & put her & the rest of the house on edge. I enjoyed the oppressive effect he had on Letty. Although I still maintain that Jon's wounds cut her deeper. She genuinely liked Jon, and he led her on then rejected her at every turn, seeing right through her BPD facade, and of course this game he played infuriated her. Letty could never figure Jon out. There was a unique chemistry there between them that was fascinating to witness. \n\nI won't miss anything else though. Not the chigger colloquialisms that permeated the house and spread to Josie of all people, the howling ear rape laughter and shouting, the boring ass \"hood stories\" he rambled on about, or that stupid fucking line he kept singing over and over again (now the Hog keeps singing it). Damiel was mildly entertaining only because his existence made Letty seethe but he added nothing else of value. He was just another unfunny Jet bit that overstayed its welcome.",

Keeping your head down is usually the way to if you're not secretly a ripper gigachad who could deal with the bullies yourself.

People so concerned about the lives of people that they will never meet and really don't even know just proves how much more mentally ill the viewers are than any of the fish, including chimped out chigger damiel. Just look at the reaction of josiecels when she doesn't act like the perfect autistic princess they had in their had.",

They're starting to give me the creeps too, some of these cunts need to go outside and get some air.\n> when she had her phone during the swatting incident she asked for people to not harass her family, which just confirms that she whether saw the threads or was already scared just by seeing whatever weird Bjork stalker shit people were DMing her\nYeah I think I saw that one too. I don't want to imagine the state of her inbox right now, not to mention the fact that people have literally been posting photos of her and her family. The Instagram I can somewhat excuse because it's not privated, but the family pictures of her when she's like 15 is fucking weird.\n> during the interview she said she doesn't want to make a career out of online presence because she's scared of the stalkers\nAgain, don't blame her, I think she also said that she had to deal with an IRL stalker at Popeyes(?) or something.\n> some other moment someone sent another creepy love letter via TTS and Simon said \"oh my god you're such a fucking loser, these people are all fucking losers\", she laughed and said \"yeah they really are\"\nI still just cannot understand the mentality of these retards when they supposedly know so much about Josie. It honestly seems like she would be receptive to hanging out with people online platonically to game or whatever, but these idiots are taking it the full mile and professing their undying love for here when A. she has a boyfriend, and B. wants nothing to do with a bunch of sweaty online gaylords.\nThese guys need to get laid, and fast. Her instagram follows have nearly quadrupled in 2 weeks. She is going to have a meltdown when she gets out and realises that Same wasn't joking about the \"Stalkers on the computer\" joke.",
