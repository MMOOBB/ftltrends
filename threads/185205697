It was just as much waste of mental space as simping for Betty/Josie/Letty.\nA movie style fantasy that I know will eventually tear me down as I would not be to keep pretending they are cool or interesting just becuase they showed me attention.\nAlso just seeing this group of fishes have so many ups and downs, moments of love and hate, and to a majority of them this being an intense shake up to their normal lives that were on autopilot. \nI'm fucking sick of living on autopilot too where days just blur together. The only thing I look forward to nowadays are nights I sneak off for a pint of liquor where I end up listening to sad music, doom scrolling love interests, and imagine what could've been or what could be. Promising myself time and time again to make a major change but never following through.\nIt hurts noticing youre slunking back into your normal public stoic emotional self that is screaming from the inside to open up to your family/friends how you are really feeling and not just giving them the ol' \"Yeah I've been ok\".\nI'm not ok. I'm pretending I am to myself and everyone in order to coast through life.",

Almost all of those alt-right e-celebs come off looking like complete douchebags and degenerates. They're all rats in a cage gnawing at each other just to get attention from anyone who will watch. I watched AF once or twice just to see what all the fuss is about and its unbearable. They're all insufferable and as a side I don't think Metokur is funny either. The only thing he ever did that was entertaining to watch was the Montagraph streams.",
