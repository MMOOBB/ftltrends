It is truly a marvel of the world, and very beautiful. It fits Josie perfectly, for she is a marvel and also very beautiful.

It tells them that the annoying TTS shit might be more annoying than its worth since it may not be making them much of anything. And the chargeback shit has repercussions that are annoying to deal with. So basically all TTS would be is an easy annoyance for the audience to use while not actually netting the staff any significant money. Why would they leave it on if the majority of it is free token bullshit or chargebacks?",
