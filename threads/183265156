Have a bathroom cam set up for this ready to go for the aftermath.\n\nThen, when they wake up and see the toilet is clogged and full of shit, nobody will want to flush it/unclog it out of principle. You then gaslight them into thinking that it was one of the other contestants. \"The person who did it knows what they did\", and \"unfortunately it's actually considered a biohazard so we can't subject our employees to cleaning the toilet up in it's current state, the person who was responsible will have to handle it or the bathroom will be out of commission for days while we find someone who is okay with signing a release to be on camera to help\". \n\nDue to the size of the shit, suspicion will likely fall on Mauro, who will autistically and non-credibly defend himself. He will then be social pressured into unclogging the mess in the toilet that he genuinely didn't make but everyone strongly suspects he did.",
