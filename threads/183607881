Just as loud when they speak and do shit and one that will not shut the fuck up unless you physically remove yourself from him and does not recognize when you don't want to talk. The fucked thing is they're just dumb but not malicious and just want you to be their friend but their existence is grating after 20 minutes because i can't stand naturally loud people and you can tell they're lying to you in an effort to make themselves better in some way. They are the purest definition of steam of consciousness because everything that they say is as it comes. You'll never see them get stuck in the middle of a sentence for a second and try to figure out how exactly they want to form what it is they're trying to say to get the point across as concisely as possible. \nIf jon would just not lie and not be obnoxiously loud at all times, I think he would be much more favorably looked on and the worst they would fuck with him is making him say words funny. If it weren't for the speech impediment, I think him being overbearing would have gotten checked more growing up and most likely made him a much more sociable person. Instead people just quietly leave him, and he never truly solidifies why people do this.",

The Fishtank website will be down for a while, and it's all because of a silly cookie incident.\n\nYou see, my buddy Sam stole my cookies the other day and I cried really hard because of it. I know it sounds childish, but those cookies were special to me. I've been trying to find them ever since, and that's why I haven't had time to work on the website.\n\nI'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but I hope you understand that sometimes, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. And in this case, what I gotta do is find my cookies.\n\nBut don't worry, I won't rest until those cookies are back in my possession and the Fishtank website is up and running again. I appreciate your patience and your support during this difficult time.\n\nThanks again for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJet Neptune",

Where the failing becomes their fault, is not trying to better their personality. He is an insecure, overly sensitive child. He thinks in order to overcome his the poor character traits he needs to elevate his status in other ways. This is why he lies, one ups everyone, and talks louder than everyone. It's an attempt, in his mind, to make himself bigger socially, despite his shortcomings solidifying him in a lesser position. He's been told to be confident, but wasn't given the tools to actually develop confidence so what we see is a facade, which is what his idea of confidence looks like. I feel bad for him in ways, bit ultimately he is his own biggest enemy for being unable to treat himself like an adult",

The housemates, all young and lively, are constantly on their toes as Jet works his mischief. The show streams 24/7, capturing their daily lives and Jet's endless shenanigans. He'd sneak up on them with a whoopee cushion or place a harmless fake spider in their cereal box, laughing while he does it! Turning to the camera, he'd say, \"Why so serious, viewers?\" Then he'd move on to his next prank... \"Why so serious?\" As Jet playfully teases the housemates, he'd exclaim, \"Let's put a grin on those faces!\" And... why so serious?",

His eyes were tired, and his stomach was grumbling. He realized that he had been so focused on his work that he had forgotten to eat lunch.\n\nAs he sat at his desk, staring at the screen, he couldn't concentrate. He felt like his brain was foggy, and he just couldn't think straight. He knew he needed to take a break, but he didn't want to waste any time. He glanced at the clock and realized it was already past 2 PM. He needed something quick and satisfying to eat.\n\nJet thought for a moment and decided that pizza would be the perfect solution. He quickly ordered a large pepperoni pizza and sat back down at his desk to wait for it to arrive.\n\nWhen the pizza arrived, Jet eagerly grabbed a slice and took a big bite. The warm, cheesy, and delicious flavor of the pizza instantly rejuvenated him. He felt the energy surging back into his body as he ate slice after slice.\n\nAs he ate, he started to think more clearly. Ideas began to flow into his head, and he felt like he was ready to tackle the challenges of the fishtank website again. He finished the last slice and stood up, feeling recharged and ready to dive back into his work.\n\n\"I needed that pizza break,\" he said to himself. \"I'm ready to get back to work now.\"\n\nWith a renewed sense of focus and energy, Jet sat down at his computer and got back to work on the fishtank website. He was able to work faster and more efficiently than before, and soon he had made significant progress.\n\nIn the end, Jet realized that taking a break to eat pizza was just what he needed to get his creative juices flowing again. He knew that the next time he felt stuck, he wouldn't hesitate to take a quick break and grab a slice of pizza.",

                "comment": "Jet Neptune had been working on fixing the website for Fishtank Inc. for hours, but he just couldn't seem to get it right. He was determined to fix the problems that had been plaguing the website for weeks, but his frustration was starting to get the best of him.\n\nSuddenly, in the middle of typing out some code, Jet felt a strange sensation come over him. He began to feel hot and sweaty, and his muscles started to ache. He tried to shake it off, but it only seemed to get worse.\n\nBefore he knew it, Jet's body began to contort and change, his bones cracking and shifting. Within moments, he had transformed into a massive gorilla, towering over his computer desk.\n\nAt first, Jet was confused and scared. He tried to use his human hands to type on the keyboard, but his massive gorilla fingers made it impossible to type out the code correctly. He felt helpless and frustrated as he watched the website's progress come to a halt.\n\nAs the days went by, Jet realized that he was stuck in his gorilla form. He couldn't return to his human body, no matter how hard he tried. The Fishtank website was left unfinished, and Jet was left feeling lost and alone.\n\nHe tried to find ways to use his gorilla form to his advantage, hoping to help others in some way. But every time he tried to help, he only seemed to cause chaos and destruction. Jet started to feel like a monster, a creature that was not meant to exist in the world of humans.\n\nEventually, Jet had to come to terms with his new form. He realized that he could no longer fix the website, but he could still help others in his own way. He started to explore the world as a gorilla, trying to find a place where he fit in.\n\nAs he traveled, he discovered a sanctuary for animals in need. Jet felt like he had finally found his place in the world. He decided to stay at the sanctuary and help the other animals there. Although he could no longer work on the Fishtank website, Jet had found a new purpose, and he was finally at peace.",

                "comment": "Jet Neptune was a skilled web developer who had been tasked with fixing the Fishtank website. He was excited to get started, as he had heard that it was a challenging project that would allow him to flex his coding muscles.\n\nJet worked diligently for hours, typing away at his computer and pouring over lines of code. But then, something strange began to happen. His skin began to darken, turning a deep shade of black, and his muscles bulged with newfound strength. He felt a strange sensation between his legs, and when he looked down, he was shocked to see that he had grown an enormous penis.\n\nJet was bewildered and frightened by this sudden transformation, and he wasn't sure what to do. He tried to continue working on the website, but he found that he couldn't concentrate. His mind was clouded with thoughts of his new body and what it meant for his identity. He was no longer the same person he had been before, and he didn't know how to reconcile that fact with the work he was supposed to be doing.\n\nEventually, Jet had to admit defeat. He couldn't work on the Fishtank website anymore, not with this new body and all the distractions that came with it. He tried to explain the situation to his boss, but they didn't believe him. They accused him of slacking off and not taking his work seriously.\n\nIn the end, Jet was forced to quit his job and seek out a new life for himself. He struggled to come to terms with his new body and the implications it had for his future. But he also found that there were people out there who accepted him for who he was, regardless of his appearance. And slowly but surely, he began to build a new life for himself, one that was free of the constraints of his old identity and the expectations of others.",
