                "comment": ">>184710410\nOk here's a serious proposal for an idea for content:\n\nIt's a team elimination challenge. Team Josie and Team Letty. Sylvia and Vance are assigned to team up with Josie or Letty. There is a preparation phase. Sylvia and Vance have 30 minutes or something to put as many articles of clothing on Josie/Letty as they can or want. That means as many shirts, pants, whatever on them as they want. BUT...they also have to place 5 bras and 5 pairs of panties on each of them. It can be hidden on them anywhere but no-no areas(not counting the one set they're already wearing on them)\n\nSo after they're all prepared with tons of clothes on each other, the contestants line up in the play area:\n\n[=] is a hamper/basket\nX is a contestant\n______ is the playing field\n) is a line that Sylvia/Vance can't cross\n\n[=]Vance__)______Josie and Letty fight area_______(___Sylvia[=]\n\nJosie and Letty wrestle each other trying to find where the hidden panties and bras are and throw them to their teammate to put in the hamper. First team to get all the panties and bras or team with the most panties/bras secured in the hamper after 3 minutes wins. The winners each get fishbucks and safety. The losing team will have one of its members eliminated.\n\nThere, I already put way more effort into a fishtank challenge than fucking Sam and his cronies ever did.",

                "comment": ">>184711823\nI was trying to sleep, but started thinking about some shit. The whole bummybuster ig account was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The page was unique in that it was solely for damiel and there was no actual satire involved. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see dam get his bummy busted. He was the obvious choice considering his total fagness at every turn. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, damiel has been pretty diligent in talking about his gay fantasies and projecting them onto others to hide, yet with this page he seemed to embrace the thing throughout the entire day. He left his wood exactly where his daddy jerked it for hours while he asked for to be dommed and buck broken. When they finally forced themselves into his bummy, he just sat there in ecstasy in the middle of a pile of xanax pills and olive oil. Now, whether or not the viewrs knew from the get-go that he was actually a faggot, it's obvious that theye're privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that dam didnt want to be perceived as a homo so everybody could laugh at him getting his bummybusted ironically, so he won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that he could do, get his bummy busted unironically, thus denying big-brains the pleasure of watching her him get buck broken, while simultaneously fooling the small brains into thinking that he actually WAS getting buck broken. This shit even had Vance and Sam wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: damiel is THE only truly gay character on this piece of shit show. Lance has been watching everything, mogged damiel in person for a while, and already admitted that he can gauge him and knows that she is being both serious and not serious at the same time, about the fag shit. he truly is the queer of the realm.",

The contestants are observed 24/7 as they complete challenges and socialize with each other. Anon meets a sweet young woman named Josie who is clearly different from the other contestants. She flaps her hands, stims constantly and fidgets with her spinner. Though Josie speaks in an eccentric, childlike manner, Anon finds her innocence charming.\n\nOver time, Anon and Josie grow closer. Josie loves to talk about anime and rhythm games, her passion shining through her shyness. Anon listens patiently, falling deeper under Josie's spell. One night after a challenge, Anon and Josie sit close on a couch. As Josie talks excitedly, Anon gently takes her hand to still it. Josie looks up at him, her amber eyes wide. Anon leans in and kisses her softly.\n\nJosie kisses back hesitantly, then with more confidence. Anon caresses her long black hair as their kiss deepens. Josie makes quiet noises of pleasure, gripping Anon's shirt. They stand and move to Josie's small room, never breaking their kiss. Josie's back hits the wall as Anon pulls her slim body flush against him. Anon's hands slide under Josie's shirt to caress her soft, perfect breasts. Josie moans, grinding her hips against him. Anon whispers \"You're so beautiful,\" making Josie gasp. Their clothes come off in a frenzy of desire and lust finally consumed them both. Josie wraps her long legs around Anon's waist as he lifts her up. Their lips meet again in a passionate kiss as Anon slowly pushes inside of her. Josie whimpers and pulls Anon closer, unaccustomed to such intimate contact but wanting more. Anon begins to move within her, eliciting soft gasps and cries of pleasure from Josie.",

The quiet intensity builds between them until Josie cries out Anon's name as she climaxes, her inner walls gripping him tightly. Anon follows shortly after, spilling his seed inside her as they cling to each other, savoring this powerful connection they've discovered.\n\nThey lay together in Josie's small bed, exhausted but sublimely happy. Josie's body fits perfectly against Anon's as she absentmindedly twirls her hair with one hand and fidgets with her spinner with the other. Anon gently kisses the top of her head, taking in the sweet innocence and beauty that is Josie. Though the reality show continues, their bond remains - a passionate spark that transformed two lonely souls. Anon hopes this is only the beginning for them both.",
