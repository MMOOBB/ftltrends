To most of these people the show is associated with Sam Hyde and it's considered social suicide to acknowledge or co-sign him. The thing is, these people are still mentally living in 2016. They don't realize that the culture has shifted underneath their feet. They don't understand that an entire generation of zoomers have grown up with Sam and his hijinks. It's actually kind of insane to think how ahead of the curve MDE was. They were an entire generation ahead of their time. \n\nMDE never truly connected with millennials. What hit with millennials was stuff like H3H3, Idubbbz, and Filthy Frank. MDE always sat on the fringe and never quite seemed to make it regardless of Sam's self-sabotage. The next 5-10 years could be peak MDE where we see Sam and co. enter into the stratosphere. It's insane to think that everything MDE did up until this point was basically the introduction to their story. MDE is connecting with an entirely different gen to the point that it might in the future become more closely aligned with zoomer culture than anything else. The fact that their YouTube streams are some of the most popular and most donated on the entire site is beyond insane. \n\nI just can't see MDE doing anything but thriving at this point, if it was a stock I could invest in, I would go all in. They already went through being cancelled and blacklisted and came out the other end. In fact that might literally be the metric of what survives in the future. There really is a new media landscape being shaped before our very eyes and stuff like MDE & Fish Tank is at the absolute forefront of it.",

We have plenty of evidence of Twitch streamers who have been banned and forced to stream off-site. They never capture even a small percent of their original audience. The numbers on Twitch are huge because of the platform, not because of the content. \n\nIf Fish Tank was allowed on Twitch it would likely receive 10 times the audience it has now. All of Fish Tanks numbers are organic and from pure word of mouth. There are Twitch streamers with several dozen times the views of Fish Tank who can't draw anywhere near the same donos or merch sales. Fish Tank is being artificially kept down in the dirt because it can't utilize the worlds largest live streaming platform and it's STILL doing exceedingly well. \n\nIt's no different than trying to run a business and being banned from Google or Paypal. It's not remotely fair and you're being hugely disingenuous. The amount of discussion Fish Tank has generated across 4chan and the wider internet is also insane. No other streamer is doing numbers like this right now. It's one of the most popular events to hit 4chan in years.\n\nComparing it to Twitch is a huge farce. If you forced every Twitch streamer to do what Sam is doing right now and take their stream off-site only a handful of them would be able to match his numbers. All the rest would fail.",

I think what you're actually trying to say is the difference between sympathy and empathy.\nEmpathy is feeling what someone else feels, while sympathy is just the rational understanding of someone else's feelings.\nEmpathy is putting yourself in a sad person's shoes, because if you imagine you were them you would be feeling sad as well.\nSympathy is seeing someone else crying and realising they must be sad.",

I dunno about someone like Peter Thiel but another person who immediately comes to mind is Notch. All it takes is a couple guys like that to enjoy his humour and all the chaos he causes and the regular gains he makes in the culture war and you can pretty much guarantee anything he does like Fish Tank is gonna be funded. Just look at all the people who publicly reached out when the site was having streaming issues at the start and then consider that three times that amount likely reached out privately. \n\nI seriously would not bet against Sam at this point.

Letty obviously went along with it because she's a sport. \nAfter getting shit from strangers over tts and being laughed at and ostracized by the rest of the house, you would definitely \"stew,\" and the fact you're trying to deny this shows your lack of empathy to any degree.",
