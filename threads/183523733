However, he showed he can actually be legitimate to people for a moment when the time calls for it (Letty\u2019s group). Amazing transformation as being a character that contestants enjoyed seeing yo something they now dread\n>Everyone, aside from the hog, is contributing to the show in their own way, for bettter or worse. I still think Jon and Josie get too much praise - yes, they\u2019re great for the show, but if you identify and support either of these two, maybe reevaluate your life\n>While Jon\u2019s sketch was forgettable and only won because Josie was in it (all voting will be skewed towards her because of retarded simps), Letty\u2019s group delivered some of the most incomprehensible, cringe-inducing moments of the show. Truly a highlight for Simmons, Sam\u2019s reaction to it all, and just how long it drug on\n>Everything feels up in the air with the imposter business now wrapped up (possibly) and the events of last night.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that things will only continue to ramp up from last night. There was a good two hours - the entire time Sam was there - that was must watch material. So many highs and lows, genuine cringe and laughter, mood shifts and surprises. I\u2019m really still in awe of how much things felt like they shifted last night. As Vance said \u201cThings feel real now\u201d.",

It's not like their sketch was some brilliant piece of comedy, but there was something there that had a visceral reaction with people. But the other sketch won because it had Josie in it, which unfortunately we'll see more and more thing skewed her way. Believe it or not, I think that's why part of Sam's talk with her and her team last night was half-way legitimate. Obviously he was fucking around at parts, but he dropped the act for a second and even called Jon a \"fucking retard\". I think even Sam recognized that, despite all of its flaws, it was better than whatever that weak shit Jon and his team put on.\n\nBut never mind, I'm a retard for reading too deep into all of this. Sam is obviously playing 5D chess with everyone except for Jon who he genuinely respects for his morals and willingness to workout with him.",
