It's a constantly difficult balancing act of letting people get under each others skin for content without fully breaking them and by extension the show. Considering this was the test run above and beyond a difficulty of anything hes done in his life before this, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.\nCasting wise, besides all of them being fringe creative types, they're fairly different. There's only so much you can gleam from audition tapes before getting them in a live improv setting for over a month and only so much you can expect to come organically. You have to remember that reality shows are cut down to 30 minute episodes for a reason.\nIf there's a season 2, that will be where any harsh criticism of how it's run should be given because of all the black and white lessons he should have learned while running this.",
