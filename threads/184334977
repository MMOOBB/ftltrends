There's the whole subset of people who whenever Sam is mentioned, they have to Markypost and says what a piece of shit he is, then there's the whole subset who just constantly complain and call everything Sam puts out, or everything Fishtank absolute shit, despite constantly watching it. Then there's the whole subset of people who seem to see Sam as some dad figure who they need to model their life after.\n\nThe absolute minority, maybe just a silent majority like me, is people who just enjoy the stuff and that's the end of it.

This shit died when Mauro Chief left and it's been nothing but death rattle since. Look at it right now, it's ideas Sam has directly took from these threads and implemented in the absolute worst way possible. I'm convinced WP didn't get canned because of politics but because Sam is an incompetent retard who needs people like Nick and Charls to carry him around. Fucking disgraceful this shit is.",

And it also explains a lot about the faggot Chigger bottom-bitch and his shameless attempts at making a pass at Jose over here. Imagine being mogged by Fem-King Cobra and lard ass Bozo. I'm almost convinced Jet & Sam first saw the video, had a giggle and threw Jose in as a joke to make money off the weeb & troon watchers. but it's getting out of control. Idk if they're telling the gook to flirt with the tranny or not, but notice how inseparable they're becoming, sleeping in beds together, going above and beyond to defend each other for no reason? the fuck is really going on here? Is it true Chigger is slipping this bitch pills now? jesus, wrangle your spergs Jet, before fishtank becomes Ram Ranch.

There's probably a lot they've missed that could have helped them in their managing of the contestants",

The only thing \"gay\" about Jon is the metrosexuality and tryhard masculine signaling (\"I can do 26 pull-ups, I got jumped\"), both of which work to make him come across as massively insecure about his sexuality. Normal dudes don't \"act\" or \"feel\" straight or masculine. The peacocking Jon engages in makes him look suspect because it betrays the natural confidence a guy is expected to have in what are assumed to literally go without saying. If you have to say it all the time, then something might be up.\n\nI'm not gay so it's possible I'm overlooking some esoteric gay tell, but to me it seems fairly obvious he's just latching on to a prominent internet personality because he's an insecure 20-something who lacked a positive male rolemodel growing up. Many people latch on to Sam the same way.",
