I will also suspect all the \"but muh content, this is prime content\" posters whenever criticism is brought up are Jet and the MDE crew coping and seething. As I said before many times people that use the word \"content\" instead of entertainment are merely shit at making things people want to see and cope with the excessive usage of content and also deciding to label themselves \"content creators\".\n\nAnyone have the Jet tweet about god protecting the show?",
