The men have breakfast and talk with each other, Letty hangs out with them while Sylvia stays in bed. TTS messages are blaring in her room calling her a fat hog and Stankypit. \nDamiel starts punching the wall of his room which wakes up Josie. Jon goes upstairs to see if they want breakfast.\n\nThe group hangs out and talks about their sleep habits. Vance congratulates Damiel on winning the skit contest, Mauro looks really happy. Josie comes down and sits down in the spinny chair and eats her bacon while playing with her stuffed animals. \n\nThe squad retire to the couch while Simmons cleans up after Jon. Letty plays Go-fish with Jon and they talk about Andrew Tate and UFOs. A TTS prank message comes in and tells them that the ruins of Atlantis have been found. Everyone starts to joke about it and Jon takes it seriously. Vance looks bored. \n\nIn the afternoon Sam brings over a bucket of KFC chicken which Sylvia and Mauro look happy about. Jon refuses to eat any of the chicken but helps pass out plates for everyone. Damiel goes back upstairs to sleep and Josie starts running around the couch. Sylvia lets out a huge fart that everyone pretends not to notice but Letty laughs about it. \n\nIn the evening everyone is sitting around the couch and decide to play truth of dare. Vance dares Jon to kiss Josie but he refuses so he asks him if he ever smoked marijuana which Jon admits to only once. Sam yells on the intercom \"NO WEED\" to which the gang all laugh. Letty goes next and picks truth, Simmons asks her if she has ever hooked up with a black guy and Letty says \"No i don't think so\". Next it's Sylvia's turn and she gets asked if she would ever do a porno which she says yes. \n\nJosie, Damiel and Mauro go upstairs to sleep. Jon stays on the couch and talks with Letty, Vance stays too to chill with Jon.",

Everyone who paid is interacting on fishtank because it's why they paid. The rate the $30k got burned through shows what their viewership realistically was considering how much fucking money they've spent on data to do it. \n\nIf they swap to cloudflare and fix the stream, it's still going to be $50 a head for someone to watch the whole show for free.
