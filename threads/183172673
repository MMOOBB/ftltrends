The hoodie will be first to go but she will keep her shoes on. She's ashamed of her feet as she's never been to get a pedicure before. She's not a girly girl. The heat continues to rise and her greasy bangs stick to her head like she'd stick to her father's side (if he had stuck around). Eventually she will have no choice but to release her feet from their sweltering shoe prison. Her naked toes will be reveled to God and everyone watching. She will wiggle her toes in front of a fan and the smell of sweat and burnt popcorn will permeate the entire fishtank house. Then I, who has been laying in wait under the house in a full ghillie suit, will shuffle my nose from the vines and inhale as deeply as a newborn child. The stench of her feet will live inside me. A part of me forever.",
