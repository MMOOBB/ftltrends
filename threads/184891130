There have been tons of ideas in these threads on how to structure the show to result in more content and more day to day viewership. \n\nLots of simple things like small daily challenges, reworking fishbucks, reworking eliminations so fish stay in the house but lose a shot at the prize (can still play foe fishbucks), viewers can submit challenges so fish can win a lootbox, etc. This show could be way better with just a week of pre-planning. I'm sure a lot of you will disagree with me but for such an obvious low effort scam, this has been pretty fun and future seasons, if they happen, could be really fun.\n\nAlso they have to bring josie back as a hostess or maid or something",
