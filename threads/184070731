Just force him to relive that over and over. Maybe invite Tim Heidecker to the house to laugh at him, and call him a Chud. How long would he put up with that shit?",

TTS about him being censored was just evening the playing field.\n>b-b-but he gets special privileges\nEveryone goes downstairs when stressed, everyone makes requests from Jet and has them fulfilled.\n>b-b-but he gets away with not participating in challenges\nSo he never wins any fisbucks. In fact he's treated the worst because both challenges that he won didn't even count (the skit challenge elimination immunity was ignored, he didn't receive anything for winning Hyde and Seek II). He even had both hands taped in the cooking challenge when everyone else only had one hand taped. They fucked him over on the hot dog challenge knowing he was reluctant to eat pork.\n>b-b-but they show him favoritism\nHe was kicked in the face, humiliated by being told to wear a helmet all the time, repeatedly singled out by sharks until he literally began intimidating them, they even tried to force Jetty by putting him in a room with Letty alone twice.\nJon has been through the wringer,\n\nIf anything Josie is the most privileged.

It could cause some schisms and some bitches to leave but also show some fishes that they're taking this for granted when they shouldn't. Show them how replacable they are and give the opportunity for the others to shine and not have their potential ruined by the overbearing tard, as good hearted as he is.

The challenges, Sam coming in, tts, voice sounds, fishtoys, the Simmons expulsion etc. There is no point in scheming. No point into manipulating other fishes because the fishes don't vote each other out. It's all based on who is the most loved by the audience and Sam kicks out the one who is useless (or so we think considering we're 3 weeks in and no one has been naturally removed from the fish tank). It's all fake. It's not a show based on skill or outlasting other fishes for 6 weeks in the tank. It's about if you are entertaining or not. Sam comes in, does something funny, everyone laughs, then he fucks off and repeat for 6 weeks. The fishes just clean, sleep, and talk back to tts as that is all there is to do. Simple as.",

It's like the rest of the cast has also been brought there to be punished for their sins, and due to the additional sin of avarice (willing to put up with it for the prize) they'll stick through it until their inevitable dramatic expulsion, getting nothing but a few hundred bucks in exchange for the rest of their lives being ruined. Everybody there has something very fucked up about them (well, not sure about Vance, but probably) and it's being revealed and broadcast to the world forever, just for a couple hypothetical dollars.\nYou could take \"Hell House\" in the literal hell sense, or the \"hell is other people\" sense, but either way, they're being tormented by an all-too-willing tormentor for his own gain, and confronted by their own reflections, the other unrepentant denizens of the house.\nYes I'm schizoposting, but I wouldn't be surprised if this gets real dark at the end, and the contestants lives are dramatically worse afterwards.",

The core audience of this show are insane 4chan anons so that by default gives it an incredibly dreadful atmosphere. But while the TTS and chat is riddled with wrathful individuals, you have a lot of generous people giving the contestants support and love. It's an extremely dark and weird show, but it presents something very bleak about the human psyche. This show is not for normies and it definitely brings out the worst in people. After this entire shit is over, I'm sure the fish will have developed a very strong mental fortitude and I'm sure it'll help them for the better. It'll either be that or they commit suicide. .",
