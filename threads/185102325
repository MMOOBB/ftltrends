No... one... would... care. In fact some, if they noticed my absence, might feel an odd, indefinable sense of relief. This is true: the Tank is better off with some Fish gone.

Myself is fabricated, an aberration. I am a noncontingent Human Fish. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Fish Tank) if they ever did exist. I shake black babies to death: there are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the Uncontrollable Jon and the Insane Chris, the Vicious Hog and the Evil Hawaiian, all the coprophillic mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward sanitation, I have now surpassed. \n\n>I still, though, hold on to one single borderline truth: no one is safe from elimination challenges, no Fish Buck is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of Fish behavior must be assumed to have some simp validity. Is evil something Fish are? Or is it a bit Fish do? My UTI pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better Tank for any Fish. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on Free Loaders. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this \u2014 and I have countless times to TTS, in just about every OSHA violation I\u2019ve committed \u2014 and coming face-to-face with these fecal truths, there is no cunt-catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confessional has meant nothing \u2026\u201d",

It was a 1080p live feed so clear and real and vital to me that in its purity it was almost abstract. \n\n>This was what I could understand, this was how I lived my Fish Tank life, what I constructed my toe-walk movement around, how I dealt with the tangible. This was the geography around which my reality television being revolved: it did not occur to me, ever, that Fish were good or that a Free Loader was capable of change or that the Tank could be a better place through one\u2019s own taking pleasure in a feeling or a look or a gesture to the camera, of receiving another person\u2019s TTS or loot crates. Nothing was affirmative, the term \u201cgenerosity of American Spirits\u201d applied to nothing, was a cliche, was some kind of bad joke. \n\n>Sex is mathematics, just ask Airsoft on the PSAT section. Waifuism is no longer an issue. What does intelligence signify? Define reason. Desire- meaningless. Sharing links is not a cure. Justice is dead. Fear, recrimination, innocence, sympathy, guilt, waste, failure, grief, were things, emotions, that no one really felt anymore. Reflection is useless, the Tank is senseless. Evil is its only permanence. God is not alive. Plushies cannot be trusted. Surface, surface, surface, was all that anyone found meaning in \u2026 this was Jason Golstriker as I saw it, colossal and violent \u2026\u201d",

The schools of Hillel and Shammai go back to the roman empire where they'd differ on how Jews were to live with gentiles. Thew Jews both work with and against each other, they have both a mystical schizophrenic idealistic component and also a rationalistic, materialistic atheistic component.
