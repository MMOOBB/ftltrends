Obviously I don't think they should implement a no-laughing rule (although it would make a hilarious challenge), but I think in terms of a baseline this is what they should strive for. For example, Gaki no Tsukai has lots of recurring characters that show up to get a laugh out of contestants. If we are to translate this to Fish Tank, it would be like the business guy showing up several times (like when he came back to have a 1-on-1 with Vance) to torture the contestants. However, in Fish Tank, the humor comes less from the contestants witnessing something funny and more from the viewer witnessing the contestant go through something torturous.\n\nAnother aspect of Gaki no Tsukai is the \"ritualness\" of it. GnT usually has a rhythm to it: get introduced to the location they will be staying at for 24 hours, go through a challenge or two, chill out in a room for an hour or two as the contestants joke with each other, another few challenges, go to sleep. Obviously Fishtank cannot have this many challenges, but it would be very good for the show if they had some sort of set schedule and a set amount of \"playtime\". I think this would be doubly good because it would keep contestants from sleeping in constantly if they knew there would be some sort of event or challenge at one or two set points during the day.",

They have not had a legitimate protest or revolutionary movement, despite the noise they make.\n\nThey are losers, they will never be white, and they will never accomplish anything.\nI can hardly blame them though, they were overshadowed by the collective accomplishments of millennials, and grew up on Dan Schneider mind poison.\nThey have no taste in music, film, or art.\nThey don't have the attention span to enjoy anything, really. The only thing that can bring them satisfaction is constant distraction.\n\nThe men are so weak they became pill heads, or fake christcucks, or take steroids at the gym and grasp for any straw of manly identity, but it always seems out of reach.\n\nUnfortunately they are irredeemable. They should collectively kill themselves and help make those 2025 population numbers a reality.",
