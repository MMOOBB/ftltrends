Vance and Josie are at least trying to do interesting things.\nHowever, it is confirmed the PSAT was rigged for letty.\nIt is confirmed she whined to get frank removed early.\nIt is confirmed she whined to get Betty removed.\nShe said last night she knows that she's going to win and can't explain why right now. \nShe has only one skill, being a whining ambulance chasing piece of shit, and the show is being rigged for her to win because either Sam wants to fuck her or she's threatened to cause legal problems.\nIn either case it's fucking boring and kills the show for me. It's been lower and lower effort, they haven't sent up sharks as much or emptied out trash all over the floor in a while, challenges are sloppier and sloppier, Goldstriker less and less",
