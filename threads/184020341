Every time she asked for a favor her humility would be required and she would not get what she asked for until I saw in her eyes the honest pleading beyond the inherent desire to manipulate. She would begin to look forward my playful but stern demands and not only my help but my approval would become her addiction.\nIt's a shame they'll rotate disabilities every day because I think by the end of the week I could break her enough to let me unclothe and bathe her.\nThe muffled glances of intoxicating attraction washing over her face as I meticulously worked my way down, making sure no corner of her pretty little body was left unpurified, but also unperceived, would be my ultimate reward.",

But, uh, yeah, he's really into books and stuff, like, he has this huge collection of old hardcover novels that he's been collecting for years and I don't think I've ever seen him without a book in his hand, except maybe when he's sleeping, but even then he probably has a book under his pillow or something, and, um, he's always been really supportive of me and my interests, even if he doesn't always understand them, like, when I told him I wanted to be a writer he was like, \"Oh, that's great, but have you considered something more stable?\" and I was like, \"Dad, I'm a millennial, stability is a myth,\" but, uh, he means well, you know? And, um, yeah, he's just a really good guy, even if he does make some dad jokes that are so bad they make me cringe, like, the other day he told me that he was going to start a band called \"The Lost Keys\" because they're always around somewhere and I was just like, \"Dad, no.\" But, uh, yeah, I love him, he's my dad, you know?",

You have no argument, so you just make shit up, like the above-mentioned. \n\n>>184021300\n>I doubt most people posting don't suck their own toes on camera.\nThat isn't even that degenerate. Also, she was probably goaded into it by her degenerate bf, she was drunk, and probably didn't even realize she was being filmed. I don't see how that's any worse than being addicted to porn and masturbating multiple times a day. Actually, it's not as bad. \n\nIt's obvious that most people calling her a whore are just projecting their uncontrollable sexual urges onto her, like a dumb animal.",
