Tuning into him after the streams went down and seeing him completely mindbroken and shrieking was hilarious and an amazing end to his arc.",

I just fucking said, if you open up with that stuff, people are just going to say \"fuck this I'm not doing this for 6 weeks\". Because you can't legally hold people against their will retard, they do have the ability to leave.Then the whole thing is either done in 4 days because nobody wants to do it, or you just have 2 people left who won't react anymore. You have to start slow, lull them into a bit of a false sense of security, and slowly make it worse for them. Because once 2, or 3 weeks have gone, then they'll stick around because they won't want it to be wasted when they have the chance of winning (also now that the whole \"fishbucks\" idea was planted).\nBut no, your socially stunted ass would rather have a 2 day long event, where you just spam the n word, crank the heat, break the toilets, and steal the beds all at once.

The reason the site went down was because sam didn't notify his bank they were going to pull money for hosting it and it got flagged to prevent fraud. All he has to do is say \"yes\" when he was asked if it was authorized.

Like see them counting rice for an hour (that weren't actually counting) is simply not fun to watch, and just and just mildly annoying.\nYou know what would be better ? Literally let them fucking be, get annoyed with each other, let them make food, let them see who throws the trash, how groups form.\nAll their \"wacky shit\" has been at best mildly annoying and mostly just unfun.",
