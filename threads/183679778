These /ftl/ threads are getting way more attention than any other show on /tv/. But, that doesn't tell you anything at all about how much cultural reach Fishtank has. \n\n4chan isn't a secret or anything, but it still gets less than 1M daily unique visitors (that's both lurkers and posters). Compared to a site like Twitter that has around 192M daily logged-in users who have taken an action that day (and god knows how many lurkers, which is always more). \n\nI'm thinking that this show isn't very popular outside of niche internet bubbles. I don't know anyone who's heard of this show who wasn't previously a fan of Sam Hyde and/or a chronic 4chan user.",
