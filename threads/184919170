They never do anything. Here is everything you are ever going to miss:\n\n-They talked\n-They slept\n-There were loud noises and bad audio\n-They made a mess\n-They halfheartedly did some halfbaked roleplaying skit or challenge\n-A freeloader or shark broke something\n-On rare occasion, they get upset or try to be on their own for a while\n-Sam did some kind of painfully forced slapstick routine\n-Jet tried to explain the rules to some challenge that nobody was interested in or paid attention to\n-Someone finally got bored enough and left\n\nThat literally encompasses EVERYTHING that has happened on this show since day 1. Stop fucking asking about it.",

Theres a lot of real hard work that goes into a production like this and the back bone of fish tank (specifically) is a basement full of zoomers, so I can't be shocked that several bits, storylines, and character arcs failed. To say it hasn't been entertaining would be a lie on my part, but there's obvious wrinkles to be ironed out, and this whole experience ideally will result in an airtight fish tank season 2.",

In a non-violent way of course! I also wish her the best, the best being becoming my wife, that is what would be best for her. We will make a very good couple, get along well, I'll love her and protect her and genuinely care for her and not push her into anything she's not ready for. We will make a lovely forever couple. I have nothing but good will towards her, my heart is overflowing with nothing but love. We will be together and I will conquer the entire world to give her the happiness she deserves. She is truly my other half, and I am hers, pieces broken and lost a long time ago. There is a synchronicity at play here, a congruence of many, many different factors perfectly aligning for this moment in both of our lives to occur, for this reality to manifest at this time in our lives.\n\nI love her with all my heart and my body and my soul, she is my angel and I want to do everything for my angel.",

In Massachusetts, indecent explosure or gross lewdness can apply to a private residence in which a person exposes themselves to someone else without their consent.\n\nWhat Fatty did was unironically illegal and Josie could press charges against him. It's not grounds for a lawsuit necessarily, but Fatty could go to prison for it.",

For example, prisons and hospital rooms aren't open to the general public, but exposing oneself to a guard or a nurse can result in an indecent exposure charge.\n\nIn many states, exposure in any place visible to the public is enough to commit indecent exposure. For instance, intentionally exposing oneself inside a private home could be illegal if someone outside the home can see the exposure.\n\nIn some states, revealing your private parts to people within the same home as you can be indecent exposure. In California, for example, the exposure can be a crime \"in any place\" where other people will \"be offended or annoyed\" by it. In states with similar laws, courts have found that lewdly exposing genitals to house guests or one's own children while inside the home can be indecent exposure.\n\n(Cal. Pen. Code, \u00a7 314 (2022); Wisneski v. State, 921 A.2d 273 (Ct. App. Md. 2007); State v. Whitaker, 793 P.2d 116 (Ct. App. Ariz. 1990).)",

We would still feel pain and bleed, but would be ageless and regenerate given enough time. We would eventually incorporate bloodletting and hardcore ryona and guro fetish play into our sexlife (accelerated by her existing fetish). We would cut pieces from each other as casually as normal lovers caress and kiss. We would cut each other's tongues until our mouths were leaking copious amounts of blood and kiss to mix our life essence up in the embrace of our mouths, the mixture spilling from our locked lips down her petite breasts and my chest. We'd knock out each other's teeth to be able to kiss more deeply and more readily spill blood down our thirsty throats. Sharing an excess of bloody foreplay, because we are not just ageless and timeless but because it's fun. When I finally entered her most sacred place she would be thoroughly wet not just between her legs but in the form of streaks of blood all over her, leaked from her spilled intestines and mangled breasts, and the wide gashes all over my body that she opened through a combination of a dull knife and her own wild, lusty abandon. My throbbing member would probe the deepest reaches of her perfect sex as our bodies slipped together where new blood joined us, and stuck together where old blood clotted. I would make the depths of my affection known to her all throughout even as our nether regions ached with pleasure and the rest of our linked bodies ached with every form of pain there is. At the moment of mutual climax I would literally place my palm against her convulsing, exposed womb and gaze into her one remaining eye as she gushed her arousal fluids on to my pelvis and I emptied my seed in her. In that moment we would slit each other's throats and \"sleep\" peacefully, before waking next to each other immortally renewed.\n\nJosie would love this.",

Josie would have to try to sue the show for some kind of negligence or safety violation in arguing that they produced the environment or were careless in allowing Fatty near her where he did something criminal but that's a lot harder to argue.\n\nFatty did unquestionably break the law by getting nude in front of her, though. She could press charges against him and he would get a court date.",

That maybe hard to prove however Josie obviously behaves so strangely a court would have no problem believing shes fucked up.\nAnd all of the evidence is right on camera. With metoo such a sensitive legal issue there is no fucking way they would be taking a chance with this shit. They shut Chris down minutes after singing Simple Man. For just singing it.\n\nI don't care for any of the contestants. I think they are all dirtbags or broken people in some way but legally Josie has every right to press charges if she desires. No way would they take a risk with that. This was not planned.\n\nChris. Just like Chris chan, with his autism is so easily manipulated he heard the chat tell him to get naked and in the heat of the moment Jet probably thought this would just be a funny lark. Shows make mistakes like this all the time. It is why the rules even exist in the first place because shit like this happens.",

Her curious nature and desire for connection make her a great listener and a joy to be around.\n\nHowever, Betty is not afraid to speak her mind when it comes to men behaving stereotypically. She's easily annoyed by those who fall into the trap of toxic masculinity, and is not afraid to call them out on their behavior.\n\nWith her infectious personality and desire for genuine connection, Betty is sure to be a memorable and lovable contestant on the show.

She can cope with her own pain and trauma that was inflicted on her by not only inflicting it on cute anime characters (a way of lashing out and coping without hurting anyone for real) while also seeing herself in the characters and being able to simultaneously empathize and relate to the metaphorical pain they are feeling, being cut, having their guts ripped out, torn out, like her innocence was torn out.\n\nJosie is an angel and she needs to be loved and protected at all costs.",

These new instagram followings are quite literally bigger than the entire audience that even watches Fish Tank and it's not like Sylvia was even popular. What, like 10% of viewers said she was their favorite when Jet polled them and yet she gained like 10x the total audience of the entirety of Fish Tank right now overnight?\n\nSo much botting and fake viewer shit going on with this show and its contestants and they're really not hiding it well at all.",
