Plus he has \"lawyers\" he talked to so they probably influenced his decision. I agree that keeping Simmons on would've been great since the pedo-question would've thickened the tension between all of them. Regardless, this situation has galvanized the fish into a faggot-ass clique, with Jon being the obvious odd one out. Also, with Mauro-117 gone there's little counter balance between Vance/Damiel and Jon. This shits gonna suck now.",

While I didn't like Simmons as a contestant, I think false pedo allegations are way too real and too harsh. Way out of proportion for this little game show and now several thousands of people think he's a perdator. This just goes against my sense for justice.\n\n3. The people who made 2 possible are twitter troons and zoomers - people that make every online community including 4chan worse by their presence. Them scoring a win by bullying Simmons off sucks.\n\n4. Mauro feeling genuine fear/nausea because he bought into the pedo allegations is stupid and sad at the same time. Mauro was chill and it sucks he left because he bought into a lie frabricated by people in #3",

Chinese people are mostly autistic and present things in a very odd way, I have no doubt that he is a weird dude but he was and would have been a content machine. \nThe intervention would've been fueled by retarded pseudo-moralfags and bitter competition from other players (particularly Sylvia, Mauro [spoiler]and Vance[/spoiler], who knows she provides nothing so she uses any opportunity as a chance to tear down others in a non-funny way).\n\nThere is no good social dynamic with the remaining crew, it's going to be a 'waiting for and kissing Sam's arse' show now where they will all play the challenges \"seriously\". Yeah, we want to see them nursing toy babies and reading the bible for one week. good job retards",

After Simmon's was evicted, the contestants referred to him as a pedo and none of the fishtank staff attempted to prevent them. Simmon's could sue the fishtank company for allowing slander against him to be aired by the fishtank company. He'll probably have more of a case if it's a storyline that's included on the edited version of the show, as that means the fishtank company curated it.",
