With how big Sam is now he shouldn\u2019t have trouble attracting a ton of interest for a new right hand man. Jet was cool and all for when Sam was struggling trying to climb back up to relevance. But he doesn\u2019t need this zoomie fuckup anymore. This show is unironically the best idea to come out of independent content creation in a long time. And it is succeeding in spite of jet, rather than because of him. And that\u2019s insanely frustrating",
