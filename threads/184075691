EPIC shit.\n\ntrust us. we know what makes good content. the show wouldve had less than 10k devoted fans max if it wasnt for youtubers and tik tok. the clips are what bring in views & $$$ for MDE. yes the show is changing but thats ok. change is good. learn to give it a chance. you might even learn to love the new fishtank!\n\nbut stop crying about is cuz that shit is weird. log off cuz your obsession is legit unhealthy. just learn to take things less seriously and have a laugh, its the internet after all. i hope youll join us for season 2 :)",

Most people have settled into the stream, so the next step is to corral the existing pass buyers in with the token exchange for the bar. See, the implication of the bar is that neckbeard lardass Frank Hassle is a little extra \"reward\" for viewer donations, but there's already been a tweet between Sam and Frank that implies he was coming on regardless. You can argue that the natural conclusion to make as a showrunner is that during a 6 week run they'll likely make their \"set goal\" regardless, but considering this sudden pivot to token donations, I think my observation of disingenuous stat padding and fleecing stands. After all, more tokens spent from a person likely means they'll rebuy in. Why not keep the bar as slow as possible to keep these people hooked? It doesn't speak of viewer appreciation by offering them a little bonus caveat, it speaks of dangling a carrot over a subset of people who they know they got by the balls.",
