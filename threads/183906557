Have as many 4/4 challenges as possible. Treat the challenges with some level of serious so the audience and contestants actually care to tune in. TTS only at certain times of day, once again so viewers and contestants know when to tune in. Mess with them more than messing the house up everyday.\nLowering the number of people in the house has collapsed the chemistry, and anyone who ever called Jon out for being a loud retard is gone.\nWe all knew we were watching the end, maybe if we weren\u2019t actively aware of it.

Assuming they dont get phones again it will mellow out over next week or two, but really fucked with the first week having jon doing background investigations into the entire cast during swatting(s)\n\nLess downtime during prime time. Them sitting on the couch answering boring tts questions is not good content but I guess good money. Even mauro said it was really tame and boring.\n\nCurfew / wake up call. They should be doing stuff during daylight hours. Not waking up at 3pm and doing all the interesting stuff at 1am.\n\nActors / characters at the door. Make them required to answer the door. Strangers coming and going. Example being like jet telling them hes having a couple buddies just come and crash for the night cuz they didnt have a place to stay and its not part of the show, then have them trash a room / bed.\n\nbetter mic coverage / better quality. It sounds like shit in the rooms with AC / echo / screaming. Another camera to get better living room coverage. The area to the left of kitchen cam is too far from both to be heard well.\n\nstop letting them get a good nights sleep. The cell is a bit much for every night, but that was the expectation is difficulty existing in the house, not pizza nights, 12 hrs of sleep, and the biggest hardship they endure is having to clean up trash on the floor everytime goldstriker visits.",
