There will be no more attempts at eliminations because they can't afford to eliminate anyone anymore.\n>Josie\nWill never be eliminated until the winner is decided. Paypigs would fly into a tard rage if Josie left, and all the show's income would stop streaming in. Josiecel paypigs pay for about four to five $500 dog toy plushies every day. They are also responsible for a lot of TTS, especially Letty hate. They are also still buying her shirts. One for each day of the week!\n>Letty\nIf she leaves the show will no longer have a content generator or driving force. Letty is the only one who tries at challenges, no matter how stupid they are. Letty is also the only one who actively schemes against other contestants in an attempt to create content.\n>Sylvia\nDespite being a boring wet noodle, Sylvia exists for the sole reason to rage at Letty and cause drama. No one will go against Josie for fear of the paypig army. So Sylvia exists as an easy target who can be easily manipulated to rage out over nothing.\n>Vance\nVance serves two purposes. As the last male he is the only reason there is still an audience. If he leaves the dwindling viewer count of 5.5k would drop to less than 2k. He's also there to be manipulated by Letty just like Sylvia is.\n\nThey literally can't afford to eliminate any of the remaining contestants otherwise the show becomes way too boring.",

And the ones with the most points at the end of the show win the whole thing. That would ensure that the whole thing stays interesting from beginning to end as the insanity ramps up on a weekly basis, and that even if 1 or 2 people can't handle it and decide to leave, you still got 6-7 people who are there.",
