It's cowardly and makes Ian look like a prude, paranoid of Sam on the verge of a meltdown on stage. But I can't lie and say I don't understand his position either. \n> Ian: it upsets me that whenever Sam makes content about me, or when people talk about Sam and me, it is overwhelmingly negative towards my wife and me. His fanbase had proven to be toxic and promoted negativity that I don't want to be around I don't want to attract that crowd and I don't want to deal with any unnecessary hate. I'm not saying to end your friendship with Sam, just don't be public with him until the event ends.\nSo the response was to prove Ian right and be overwhelmingly negative and toxic towards him? What did you expect him to respond with?",

I also admit that idubz has a point about why he doesn't want Sam or Sam adjacent people around -- those people shit all over him and its his event so they gotta go. But it sucks.",

Then he (4) doesn't let Sam attend even though he trained one of the fighters and bought premium tickets.\n\nSo at this point Sam decides the bridge is just burned and milks him for content like every other lolcow farmer. It's understandable that he wants nothing to do with him now, but Ian is basically a retarded kid that burned his hand by touching a stove.",

All within around 20 square miles of me. That's how I got these rates per square mile.\nThis doesn't factor in race. I've only known white girls, Hapa girls, Asian girls, and Latina girls that act in any way similar to all her qualities. But it does factor in age ranges.\nSo lets use Los Angeles as an example:\n>469 square miles in LA county\n>rate of around 0.4 per square mile\n>187.6 girls similar to Josie in LA county\nWe can now take that number and find the rate per standard population:\n>population of LA country:\n>18,500,000 people live in LA country as of 2021\n>18,500,000 / 100,000\n>185\n>187.6 / 185 = 1.014\nFor every 100,000 people ANYWHERE in the USA, maybe even in many places of the world, there is likely to be at least 1 girl similar to Josie. Finding her at the correct local DDR spots is the real trick.\nJosie is a very unique girl. \nHope this was a whitepill for you anons that there is hope to find a girl *similar* to Josie.\nDo with this information what you will anons.....",
