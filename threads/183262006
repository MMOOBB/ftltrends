He\u2019s a fictional character who does terrible things and has no redeeming qualities. He\u2019s not someone you should idolize or emulate. He\u2019s someone you should pity and avoid.\n\nYou might think you\u2019re being funny or clever by posting Joker memes all day, but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re being boring and annoying and sad. You\u2019re wasting your time and energy on something that doesn\u2019t matter and doesn\u2019t make you happy. You\u2019re missing out on the real joys of life, like friends, family, hobbies, passions, and goals.\n\nSo please, do yourself and everyone else a favor and stop posting Joker memes. Find something else to do with your life. Something that makes you happy and fulfilled. Something that challenges you and inspires you. Something that makes you a better person and a better member of society.\n\nThere are so many things you can do instead of posting Joker memes. You can read a book, watch a movie, play a game, learn a skill, join a club, volunteer for a cause, travel to a new place, meet new people, or anything else that sparks your interest and curiosity.\n\nYou have so much potential and so much to offer the world. Don\u2019t waste it on Joker memes. Find a hobby that suits you and makes you happy. Trust me, you\u2019ll be glad you did.",

Something that makes the world a better place.\n\nThere are so many hobbies you can choose from. You can read, watch, play, learn, join, volunteer, travel, meet, or anything else that interests you.

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I\u2019ll tape a hit from my vape pen while looking at TikToks. I usually spend an hour doing this now. After I get a text from Sam asking why I'm not at work yet I get in my 2006 Chrysler 500 and drive to the office. On the way in I grab some starbucks, only the best for the bossman. Then as I enter the office I Sam usually give me some bullshit task to do which leaves me distracted until it's time to stream. I always use my phone instead of reading from the streaming computer, because I'm used to it from staring at it for 14 hours a day. Then I read, I read whatever chat tells me to read and I agree with whatever Sam and Nick say. There is an idea of a Jet Neptune. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my empty gaze, and you can look at my shitty hair and weird clothing, and maybe you can even sense our BMI's are probably comparable, I simply am not there.",

Plo Koon var en skicklig krigare och kom fr\u00e5n en familj med m\u00e5nga jediriddare. Plo Koon studerade som jedi med den legendariska wookiee-jedim\u00e4staren Tyvokka som sin m\u00e4stare. Kel Dor hade ett rykte om att g\u00f6ra snabba och tydliga beslut, och Plo Koon var inget undantag. Denna attityd tillsammans med Plo Koons tendens att vara sarkastisk gick ofta p\u00e5 nerverna p\u00e5 hans m\u00e4stare. Under hans karri\u00e4r tr\u00e4nade Plo Koon m\u00e5nga padawaner, som t.ex. Bultar Swan och Lissarkh - Plo Koons padawan under Invasionen av Naboo. Plo Koon var god v\u00e4n med Qui-Gon, och ans\u00e5g att han f\u00f6rtj\u00e4nade en plats i jedir\u00e5det, och f\u00f6rslog m\u00e5nga g\u00e5nger sin id\u00e9 \u00e5t Tyvokka, trots att de \u00e4ldre icke samtyckte. Senare f\u00f6rstod han att Qui-Gon inte fick en plats tack vare hans rebelliska attityd. Efter att ha lett republiken till seger i Stark-hyperrymdkriget efter Tyvokkas d\u00f6d blev Plo Koon republikens hj\u00e4lte och dubbad till jedim\u00e4stare. Samtidigt fick han en livstidsplats i jedir\u00e5det. Innan Plo Koon fick sitt bl\u00e5a lasersv\u00e4rd hade han ett gult sv\u00e4rd. Han \u00e4r klok , vis och en av dom skickligaste jedis som satt i jedir\u00e5det.Till och med Darth maul fruktade honom.Om inte Plo Koon skulle vart i ett skepp n\u00e4r order 66 inf\u00f6rdes skulle det funnits en stor chans til att Plo Koon med l\u00e4tthet kunna d\u00f6da sina egna soldater eller \u00e5t minnst\u00e5nde kunna fly fr\u00e5n dom som Obi wan g\u00f6r i m\u00f6rkrets h\u00e4md.>>183262735",

BUT: another actor is outside the window naked looking in and apparently masturbating. Guy in scream mask \"breaks\" character, calls the producers who come in, rush the fish to their rooms, and confer in a hushed panic. Police come and they take a \"report\".

I got hip to him through Odd Future/Supreme/Fucking Awesome circles. He skates and grew up with all those kids like Earl, Kevin Bradley etc etc etc. He's been a skater/\"internet comedian.\" He's a troll. He may not KNOW KNOW Sam Hyde or Jet mad personally but they for sure have close mutual friends. I dont think he will last too long though cuz hes a straight alcoholic, pill popper, weed smoker, etc etc. So Im sure hell be entertaining for the first day but as you can see now he has done nothing but lay in bed all day. Bros prolly detoxing lololol. But either way, without a doubt, he is a plant. His bio isnt even accurate hahahaha. Hes not Philipino and Irish.\n>He is just a kid from southern California who's in entourage circles of Earl Sweatshirt and the Supreme skate team. He was like a background person who homies with all famous cats but he's not \"famous.\"\n\nand then another person who apparently knows him\n>He's from SF. Bro he beat this chick up that he was dating a few years ago, hella bad. i remember seeing people posting about it then got his ass beat on ig live for it.\nto which the op replies\n>The Latina girl? He beat her up????? I\u2019d believe it, he\u2019s always been an unhinged goombah. He\u2019s funny as hell but he goes too hard with his bs.\n\n\nnot sure how much to believe",
