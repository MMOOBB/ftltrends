Eventually retreated to Letty's room where an alliance to deal with the issue was formed, and both went back downstairs to continue arguing with Vance\n\neventually, after no progress with the argument was made, Chris came downstairs and a slap fight was suggested. Chris pulled his slap and reluctantly did it, and Mauro went full force (no pun intended) and seriously fucked Chris up with a slap. Which, in a way, proves Vance's point\n\nMauro became very self conscious, even moreso than before, and hasn't recovered since and continues to be hungover. Did I mention he was blackout drunk during all of this and 10 minutes before the argument he was crying in the confession cam?\n\nI assume you know about the Chris vs Mauro mustard and bleach fight beforehand so that's why I didn't give that context",

The more responsible, the bigger a cut the freeloader gets for eliminating a Fish. In order to incentivize the Fish being honest about who pissed them off the most into leaving, tell them that whoever they mark was the most responsible will receive the harsher punishment according to the % they assign them when they leave(something like they'll have to down even more ultra hot hot sauce or some shit). So they'll name the people they hate.\n\nBoom, there you go. The Freeloaders are incentivized to stay and be extremely fucking annoying and the Fish are incentivized to stay. You could even restructure the Fish grand prize so that their \"cut\" gets bitten out of the ultimate prize by the Freeloaders if they leave before an official elimination or something.",
