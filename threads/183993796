I can't bear the thought of her pure heart being broken and her innocence shattered by all these disgusting, hateful people on this show. I hope I can warn her to stay away when she gets out. I want to protect her so badly. How could anyone be so mean to such a sweet girl? This world is so fucked up.",

Instead I become a grifter for lost males and red pilled loser ideology. I have no friends in real life, only orbiters and people that I have to pay to hang out with me. I can't find functional women in real life to date so I have sex with 16 year olds. Nothing I do is funny and I will never be funny, I can't write anything funny and everything I have made that is funny is done by someone else. If I see a chance to short change someone I will.

Also Asia, there are plenty of countries in Asia that now have a higher standard of living than European countries.\nGo to Japan, South Korea, parts of China and you'll find a girl who isn't just after your money.",

I would get damiel some vapes and sylvia some cherry cokes and they would make me feel really welcomed and like i was a part of the family. Josie and I would be awkward and cute together and there would be sparks but we are so socially fucked we just have a big \u201cwill they wont they\u201d. Letty and I would be fast friends but she would get kinda handsy once she knew my intentions with Josie, and she would try to make her jealous. Anyways after some \u2018za and hanging out, Jet and Sam come up and greet me like a long lost brother and beg for me to come on the show and then take me to the basement where we all hang put and they give me secret plans to play with the fish.",

                "comment": "Ok, let's just get some facts out of the way.\nFirst off, viewership is trending DOWNWARD in a big way - this is a fact. And do not brush it over with the whole \"it was always going to drop off\" bullshit. \nViewership increased steadily day after day up until the Simmons incident. Since then, each day has been lower than the last. Yesterday is the first time Sam hasn't shown up and there was no real challenge of any kind.\nSo what went wrong, unironically? I'm going to list a few things:\n>Inconsistency on rules for contestants and audience involvement. For awhile, things seems to shift day-to-day until we found ourselves to the dull version of the show we have today\n>Kicking out Simmons in such a dramatic fashion, causing Maruo to walk out the same day. Say what you want about Simmons, but I think everyone can mostly agree the situation should have been handled differently and the fallout has been detrimental to the show\n>Challenges and eliminations largely being done away with and seemingly not being enforced or upheld in any way. I know they want this thing to have a certain \"fly by the seats of your pants\" vibe, but you need SOME constants. The Sam visits, the challenge time, the elimination day - SOMETHING\n>The way the sharks interact with the fish. At this point I think everyone can agree the fish have been spoiled to a certain degree, completely altering the dynamic of the show (for the worst)\n>24/7 TTS, while a money-maker, is better used an hour or two a day to fuck with the vibe of the house and get the Fish talking\nThere's a lot more I can list, but I think anyone who has tuned in from day one will agree this thing was gotten stale. Though I disagree with the Simmons thing, and almost wonder in hindsight if they should just not have any eliminations at all, I also wonder if Sam shouldn't have just kept the pressure on and have everyone leave by week 2. It would have been a much more surreal and entertaining product then what we're currently seeing.",

The entertainment factor is secondary to Josie being on the show so that these faggots can spam her with plushies and TTS, which she's now ignoring because she's (rightfully) getting weirded out by all the attention.\nDo you want to make money from online content? You might have a bunch of ideas that would make for great entertainment, but none of them matter when you can just put a girl in front of a camera who losers think they have a chance of dating and a tsunami of money will come flowing in. Although I guess it's kind of based that all of the money is actually going to Sam and Jet. They are basically Josie's pimps at this point. Might as well squeeze the pigs for everything they have.\ntl;dr: Kill simps, behead simps, roundhouse kick a simp into the concrete, etc",

She keeps whining about being singled out for being a female, yet she seems to forget Jon has had two mental breakdowns to the point where they had to shut down the entire bottom floor and ban TTS related to him, then he got railed in the face. She took part in sissifying Simmons, and goaded everyone into publicly acting in a skit that involves Jews turning kids into trannies with vaccines then laughed when he got bullied off the show. The TTS constantly fetishizes Josie and she has no problems with any of that, but when they call her an aryan queen and Damiel refers to her as a female she seethes about it for literally days and has to find the safest possible opportunity to whine to everyone else about it because the other contestant not being on her side would send her into a panic spiral that would keep her alone in a room babbling at the wall camera for days. Despite all this, she thinks everybody on the show is a retard. I hope she gets blown the fuck out worse than Simmons.",

I think, to some degree, it has also shone a light on what Sam and his crew really find important in all this - money. Who care what the original premise of the show was and keeping to that if the money is rolling in, right? And I'm sure Sam has plenty of justification for it - calling us a dumbass or something for not wanting to make as much money as possible. But remember, Sam is some sort of supposed artist. If this was about pure entertainment, we wouldn't see the show going in the direction it is.\n\nBut like so many entertainers, it's all about money at the end of the day.",

The thing is, they were pulling in more and more viewers daily but sticking closer to the original spirit of the show. And then they've been bleeding viewers daily since the Simmons fiasco. This is an undeniable fact.\n\nYeah, the show will maintain a smaller, somewhat stable following through to end because of the massive amount of simps. But is that the audience you want? Is that the audience Sam wanted? Maybe he doesn't care because he's too busy counting their money.\n\nWhen they were actually causing chaos and letting the house develop it's won dynamic, they were gaining viewers. People WANT to watch Fishtank as it was meant to be, not whatever waifu simulator it has turned into. And the number prove that.",

Josie is getting lots of TTS messages? Keep her on as long as possible. There is no vision for this show.

But it morphs everyday, and I think it's becoming more and more clear that the main factor steering the direction is money. It was almost more novel when I thought the crew was just inept, but you can see that as the number of TTS messages increased, the viewership did not. Sure, the show will still have viewers on the last day, but what will we even be watching at that point?",

Contracts do not supersede law or revoke your basic rights. I'll give you an example. Currently the website ToS states \"no refunds\", well, this is illegal in the EU, and by allowing EU IP addresses to connect to the site, they have to abide by EU laws with EU customers. Just because they decide to say you can't have a refund, doesn't make them immune to real laws. If anyone wants a refund in the EU, just go to your bank and tell them that the company is refusing your refund, and the bank will do a chargeback for you.",
