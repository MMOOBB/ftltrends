Letty was glowing with happiness and Vance looked cringed out and Mauro looked mentally vacant. Idk how many of you were there but I used to feel bad for her for how much she was excluded from the 'main group' and it stuck with her so much she had to reinvent it. Vance is physically incapable of calling her out on any of this psychological derangement like Damiel could because he just sees his little sister that he's been biological conditioned to protect",

It would be a bad move to piss off that many obsessive fuck ups. It would actually hurt his wallet. She also makes more revenue than the other fish combined so ditching her would be financially stupid. Besides, Josie already agreed to taking 12k instead of 30k and he offered her a job on season 2. I think the crew already knows who's going to win. Josie.",

He was a big part of it a couple days prior to Franks arrival and on the first day he was there (Sylvia being the biggest Frank instigator against Letty). He must think it was way over the line but understands the reason. They seemed to have a good heart to heart when Frank left and he seemed to develop genuine sympathy towards her. I havent seen him say anything about her that he doesnt say in front of her after the Frank days but i could very well have missed it cause ive missed a lot of the last few days",
