At this point his entire shtick is that because of the whole Adult Swim thing now every time he fails its just the culture war enemies keeping him down. As if Sam being at Creator Clash would have actually helped his brand and brought him more success. Fishtank would still have been just as much of an unplanned mess. It was funny watching him come into the fishtank a few times at first but now he just sorta walks in there and spends 5 minutes being loud because loud = funny. \n\nI think I had a completely fucked view of Sam before. i put him on a pedestal. The show is better without goldstriker at this point.",

Before I say what I'm about to say I'd just like to make it clear that I never post here, mainly due to the fact that interacting with so called \"4chan culture\" is quite disheartening. So I'm going to say this as clearly and efficiently as possible.\n\nFuck. All. Of. You.\n\nThere, I said it. If you'd like an explanation, all you have to do is look at your own behavior, and understand how it effects the world around you. As a trans woman I feel the deep rooted forces of oppression you sick fucks emanate every day of my life. The shit I have to go through to please disgusting individuals such as yourselves. It doesnt help that I'm a woman of color. So on top of that, I have to deal with the fucking systemic racism YOU and YOUR people started and continue to promote. My life is a living hell because of you people. But that's not why I hate you. Oh not even close sweetie.\n\nThe problem lies with YOU. Your behavior is so sickening. I know most of you are white men and so bigotry comes naturally, but you make no attempt to hide it. No attempt to better yourselves or the world around you. And no attempt to soothe the scars caused by you sick fucks. Your treatment of others is ugly.\n\n\"Durr nigger. Durrr tranny. Durr fag. Durr cunt. Durr durr durr durrrrr look at me I'm a nazi haha doesnt this make me so quirky and a free thinker durrr\"\n\nSorry, not sorry. You're just getting what you put out. You constantly berate the disenfranchised and the unfortunate. Using your privilege as some sort of pedestal. You think you're better than me and my community when you're not. You're the scum of the earth. I hope you all rot in hell.",

They really are lazy af and honestly the way they turned it from a reality show competition based on challenges to just a directed popularity contest and it's pissed me off. There are times where it really feels like they are projecting their own personal anger at the world onto some of the contestants and it fucks up the whole reason for the show. I didn't just tune in to watch one or two people get tortured for being standin punching bags to represent 'all thats wrong with the women of today\" etc. while the rest of the contestants fuck around and spend 90% of the day unfucked with. Its gay and they needed actual rules.

And yeah they would do the challenge if he insisted but thats the thing: most of the time he doesnt because he put Jet in charge of it.\n\nAs for him being in the promo: thats how personality works. Charlize Theron is not running a bug edibles company but she was paid to be one of the faces of the campaign because she's a personality. People are more willing to buy from her than from an unknown company executive. Sam is more involved in Fishtank than Theron is on the bug company but its the same in the sense that appearing in the promo is not evidence of being in charge",
