The ranting about \"not giving [the viewers] what they want\" and about mental health inside what she knowingly is a reality TV house where the contestants signed away their right to comfort is horrible. She is actively ruining the show when she talks about her outside perspective and shit talks TTS without experiencing the brunt of blows, shit talking Frank, shit talking production from a gay kumbaya angle, ect. She incessant denial of purposely copying Josie is horrible too, it's so very obvious and horrible. The gay disaffected lesboid libtard carelessness pseudo-aloofness is a horrible personality type and makes Sensitive and Introspective Young Men like me sick to my core. The isnane BPD cry fits are totally incompatible with any direction production could take this show. Jet, Julian, Ben, whoever, please get her the fuck out, or set Sam on her hard tomorrow.",

Most of their footage is completely unusable because it's being filmed by amateur retards that couldn't get good shots to save their life.\n\nThe show is just an abject failure. Its only redeeming quality is that Sam was able to rip off a bunch of thirsty weeb losers of their government bux, though he still will barely break even on the whole project.",

Her erratic shifts between screaming, crying and laughing reminded me of an incident with a relative who had recently started taking Lexapro. We were driving home at night down a road with no sidewalks surrounded by woods. We got into a minor argument and then they drove over a pothole. Immediately breaksdown into a fit of screaming, crying, anger. Gets out of the car and says in tears that they'll walk home while basically telling me to fuck off. Had to follow them in the car for like 10 minutes until I finally convinced her that I'm not letting her walk alone for 5 miles in the dark.",
