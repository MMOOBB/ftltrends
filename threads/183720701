She is, however, Sam and Jet's primary source of income. Subscriptions won't meaningfully increase from here. Jon cannot be bullied anymore, so their primary source of income is going to be from simps attempting to communicate with her. Who is going to waste money on TTS for Vance or Sylvia? No one gives a fuck. \nIf Josie leaves now she can get some simps bucks from Twitch. It also completely screws Sam and Jet, and ensures that they go massively in the red on their shitty failed show. The longer she stays there, the more money she makes them, and the closer they come to breaking even. \nWe need to get Josie to leave.",

Sam shows up and they have a karaoke session. Josie sings twinkle twinkle little start (of course) and the ABC's (of course) and everyone joins in. Then it's Simmon's turn. Sam mocks him with laughter (later it turns out Simmons has a childhood trauma based around getting laughed at during karaoke when he was a child) Then Sam goes full power level and reveals all the Simmons dirt about him being a pervert, shows everyone an instagram post of him hitting on an 11 year old girl. Then kicks him out. Everyone is traumatized by the sudden experience (Josie is seen silently crying and hides it from the crew.) Jon locks himself in the bathroom and everything thinks he's suicided. Jet eventually talks him out. The whole crew is shook up and there's a lot of negative tension until Jet brings them all down into the basement for \"The Talk\" Shortly after the downstairs cameras get shut off for the night (announced on his twitter) to help everyone cool off after the traumatic experience. They're now eating pizza and drinking beer. A little while ago Letty came in drunk and addressed her leaked porn videos.",

He literally gets himself involved with so many fucked up women, it's more of a shock to me that NONE of them have come up to actually take legal action against him. The one time he got called on by the FBI was just some bitch making an anonymous tip, which doesn't count. \n\nI absolutely despise degeneracy, fucking hate pedos and creeps just like anyone else. I also do know on firsthand account what its like to deal with absolutely deranged people that want to wreak havoc/take revenge on you. They will do anything to make you look like the worst person that has ever lived. They will blatantly make shit up about you and exaggerate shit to the MAX. The only way to see through the smoke is to see if a) there is any proof (REAL proof, not just 'he said she said shit') and b) if they will ever confront the \"aggressor\" (sam in this case) themselves. In my experience, the people who overall should not be trusted are the ones that talk shit behind the 'aggressors' backs but when they get an opportunity to try to talk them out with the person, they will do anything to avoid doing that and would rather go back to shit talk babbling, ruining their reputation etc. \n\nThat being said, Sam is ultimately the one in the wrong for the fact that he keeps getting himself involved with so many fucked up retarded people. I understand if you fuck up when youre young you can afford to make mistakes and grow, but its a problem when you're nearly 40 and you don't learn from your experiences and don't practice what you preach by engorging yourself with hookups and getting sexually involved with unhinged women. I have zero respect for him in that regard. Other than that I wish he were the person that he tries so hard to be and preaches his paypigs to be like, but deep down he's probably more disappointed in himself than a rando online ever will.",

People were getting sick of Jon's bossy autism and a lot of rumours began flying around about Simmons being a pedo thanks to tts. Eventually Jon had this humiliating and confusing plan to steal Vance and Lett's baby (but I think he accidently stole Mauro's and Sylvia's?) and they were screaming at each other for a while. So when Simmons got kicked, I imagine Jon felt both betrayed by the fact his friend was possibly actually a pedo, and is now alone. So he just sort of broke down because of the stress.",

Now they are afraid of Sam because he's a psychotic retard who can't control his rage and they all just want to leave because of the bad energy he brings to the house. Meanwhile he and Jet are too emotionally invested in these people now and won't do anything to fuck with them. The extent to which anyone is fucking with them is basement-dwelling internet losers digging up whatever they can about them in an attempt to bully and shame them, which is terrible content because it just makes them emotionally abused and unenterataining just like Sam being psychotic around them does.\n\nIt went from \"sit back and enjoy the show\" to being overly projective about Jon and moralfagging about some stupid book and reacting like a panicked retard overdosing on outrage.",

It's fine if they kick Simmons, it's fine if they turn off TTS, but turning the cams off and giving them pizza and beer because they were traumatized over this is stupid.",

But the rule changes as it pertains to Jon (no bullying) and shutting cameras off is already changing the tone and scope of the show. It's the HugHouse now. \n\nIf Sam's smart he's gonna get a Black guy off craigslist or just some random fat mexican and call him Mauro and tell everyone to pretend its Mauro and gaslight everyone.\n\nMake it a big joke. They brought back Dam why not",

It really seems to me like they've been flying by the seat of their pants and they haven't really had a roadmap for the show. It seems like they had no idea what kind of an undertaking it would be to keep people entertained for 24 hours a day. Reality shows come in highly edited 30 minute episodes for a reason",
