And then she will talk to chat about how guilty she feels and that she's not a bad person. Combine that with the sneaky personality, the feminist rants about body hair and the crying to production EVERY TIME she gets made to feel uncomfortable and she is by far the worst there.",

This man shows up to your village wearing a military uniform accompanied by an entourage of people all carrying machine guns. He informs you that he's from Petrograd and that the workers there need food. A rumor has surfaced from an anonymous source that not only is your village hiding food, but that several of the farmers in your village harbor bourgeois attitudes toward the revolution. This is the face he makes as he presses his pistol to your fathers head and pulls the trigger. This is the look in his eyes as he orders his men to rape and torch everything. This is the true face of the kike and the reality of the Jew. This exact face is the last thing millions of innocents saw.",

The deal with that is that legally anytime that shit gets brought up it needs to be very clear what it was, which is revenge porn. Any reference to it as \"nudes\" or \"porn\" or \"camgirl\" stuff can be immediate grounds for defamation by the show for broadcasting that. The term \"revenge porn\" must be used otherwise it implies that she has posted all of that herself. \n\nThat being said, fuck Letty, but no one deserves to have a psycho like Jeremy on them, and it makes her a pretty bad candidate for the show since one wrong TTS or mention by the contestants or freeloaders can lead to them being kicked off. When people talk about lawsuits, this is the only valid one that could exist.",
