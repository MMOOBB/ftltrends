Bandwidth is bandwidth. $15k a month, even if they reduce the bandwidth by half is still unsustainable for such a small operation. Google/Amazon are the cheapest providers seeing as they're the current kingpins in the space. Any alternative provider would have to charge more due to their higher overhead. \n\nIt's over Fishbros. \n\nI can see them getting rid of 4 of the live bedroom cams, and just switching between them on one stream, reducing the quality to 480p. That might make it more sustainable.",

As you may have noticed, Fishtank website is currently down and I wanted to let you know why.\n\nThe reason behind the website being down is that I am currently in Africa fighting gorillas. Yes, you heard that right, gorillas! It's been quite the adventure so far, and I'm really enjoying this experience.\n\nUnfortunately, this means that I won't be able to work on the Fishtank website for a while. But don't worry, as soon as I'm done fighting these gorillas, I'll be back to fixing up the website as soon as possible.\n\nI know this news may come as a surprise, but I just couldn't resist this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And I'm confident that when I'm back, I'll have some amazing stories to share with all of you.\n\nIn the meantime, please bear with us and stay tuned for updates. We appreciate your patience and support.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJet Neptune",

As the producer of this little shindig, I've got some hilariously mild pranks lined up for my captives. Watch as they squirm in their seats, ha ha!\n\nFirst up, I've replaced all their toothpaste with whipped cream. Oh, the look on their faces when they try to brush their teeth in the morning is simply priceless! Squirty, minty goodness all over the place, ha ha ha!\n\nNext, I've rigged Mauro's Bed with whoopee cushions. Talk about a gas, hee hee!\n\nOh, and let's not forget the classic banana peel gag. I've scattered banana peels all over the floor, just waiting for them to slip and slide. It's like a slapstick comedy routine, right here in my little TV show!\n\nBut wait, there's more! I've swapped out their coffee with decaf. Oh, the horror on their faces when they take a sip and realize it's all a caffeine-free joke! Priceless, absolutely priceless!\n\nAnd finally, I've replaced their regular soap with slippery soap bars. They'll be lathering up like mad, trying to catch hold of the elusive soap, but it keeps slipping right out of their grasp. Slip, slide, and giggle, hee hee hee!\n\nOh, the fun we'll have in my Fishtank! Tune in, /tv/, for some wickedly mild pranks that'll keep you laughing and gasping for more! This is the Jetster, signing off with a maniacal laugh, ha ha ha ha!",

It destroys intestinal lining, affecting nutrient absorption from the gut. This could limit iron absorption even when the diet is rich in iron. Excess fluoride also interferes with production of thyroid hormones that are involved in RBC production.
