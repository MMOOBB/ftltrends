Unless some of that came later. \n\nAlso keep in mind this is all years ago so the fact he's still obsessed and has a pending case is insane.

                "comment": "Okay so recap.\n>Josie definitely wants to chop off her tits, grew up in an abusive household and still has some trauma from it. Is a cutter, stimms to not rip out her hair, wants white cock because subconsciously she wants to escape poverty (she's not into fatty despite being white. Black guys that love white chicks would at least fuck a fat white girl) has plenty of friends and goes to conventions so this act of being a femcel is probably a lie. Also really likes nigger culture and probably would hate all her neet fanbase if she met them in real life.\n>Letty, self outed herself being in her late 20's so she's going to hit the wall pretty soon if she hasn't already. Has a fucked up leg that's longer than the other one, has a fucked up eye. She gets off to manipulation as evidence by her exes and by her actions in the tank. Also gets off from making people mad and/or being yelled at in small doses (Damiel proves there is a limit to this). Has an eating disorder and is probably anorexic since she likes those liquid meal things that elderly people enjoy. She rarely shots because of these meal replacements so she is fascinated with scat because it doesn't happen very often. (Piss fetish unconfirmed due to it being a meme and she could be leaning into it.) Has a hairy beaver and gives boring head.\n>Sylvia is fat but worst of all, she's boring. She was blacked, used to be addicted to drugs but now apparently is addicted to food. Is thin skinned. Is a hypocrite. Is willing to be as nasty as Letty (she almost certainly wiped her ass with Lettie's clothes). Shit talks everyone behind their backs (everyone is admittedly guilty of this but she's the worst offender of this.) Has gone to jail more than once this year alone. Has an OF so she sells her body to weirdos for money. Looks ridiculous in her outfits and her makeup looks like clown make up. Essentially white trash.\n\nPeople really have waifu wars over these girls? Color me shocked.",
