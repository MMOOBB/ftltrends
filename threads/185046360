Anyone who has actually dealt with psycho bipolar bitches would know that none of these girls have it. They'll fly off the handle and physically attack you over the most minor conceived slight, then break out into hysterical crying where they're threatening to kill themselves, then have you choking them while she calls you daddy all within like a one hour period. \n\nBetty MIGHT have it but I'm leaning more towards her just being a good actress.",

Chris had been harassing her so the other team let her stay in their bedroom, at disadvantage to themselves, to study in peace while Vance confronted Chris. She repays this kindness by destroying their notes and hiding their book when they all got called down to living room. Then when this plan backfires on her and they end up with both books she dunks Josie's plushies in unflushed shitwater (she can't smell by the way, and has no idea the plushies she sleeps with are contaminated with feces) and starts a big argument with Sylvia by destroying her personal items, the exact thing she got Damiel kicked out for. Then the sharks step in and destroy the remaining book.\n\nShe is a total piece of shit and I want her to lose.",

She was just a prostitute that didn't care. She left after 2 days because she couldn't handle being bullied over her veganism.\n\nLet's just be honest here and call it like it is: what the viewers want is a bunch of mediocre women with interesting personalities to be stuck in the house. They badly want girls like Josie/Letty/Betty to have some sexual incidents together like kissing each other or having sex. They want weirdo males like Chris to be tangentially involved to make things awkward or interesting or help in bullying or making these girls uncomfortable. They want to see these ugly weirdo girls bullied. They want to see them nude.\n\nNone of this is inaccurate. It's what the viewers want to see. Sam has no reason not to just bring in a bunch of Betties and milk the simps.",

Betty is just symptomatic of the audience's shift toward simpdom rather than caring about an interesting Fish Tank. She's a cheap answer that was apparently wildly popular with you idiots(hey she flashed titties! What content! Even though we could go to one of a million random whore's camsites to get the same thing!)\n\nSo the show, rather than being steered toward any kind of interesting premise or having any kind of standards, just makes more sense to turn into some watered down camwhore house. It's what the current audience wants anyways and it would make the most sense for Sam to make money that way since the audience has no standards and even seems to prefer ugly women with mental illness problems which are far easier to acquire for a show like this.\n\nSo bring on the Betties.",
