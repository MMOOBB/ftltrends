What kind of parenting and influences produces this kind of spinless yeah-man?\nhe's a jock who used to play baseball, but he's not extroverted enough to be a proper bully. by nature of sportsball he was forced to be around such men, so he uses the full extent of his middling IQ to befriend and hide behind those who aren't spineless and do have opinions. Damiel, Lance, Frank etc. he's done this for his entire adult life and it's why he only acts hard if there's a total consensus on disliking someone e.g. chris just now. he got the okay when tts asked \"who hates chris\" and everybody but violetta raised their hand. violetta was obviously bothered and hiding from him and Vance likes to keep fake alliances with every fish. Vance Latta operates like a high school mean girl, weighing the pros and cons of every choice meticulously instead of being actually brash and interesting like the men in the MDE crew he idolizes. this is what leads to his cowardly fence-sitter nature and it's something Frank realized within two days of being there.",
