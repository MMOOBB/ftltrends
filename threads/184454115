You can have 100K people watching something but if they're all sheep (or children or whatever) that never create any culture themselves the stream won't have much cultural impact. Meanwhile you can have a stream with 10k viewers but if a decent amount of those viewers are content creators themselves who then go out and make their own cultural works, that much smaller stream will end up having a much larger cultural impact. \n\nThis type of thing happens all the time with music where you have bands that hardly anyone listens to but everyone who does goes out and starts their own band. We already know this is the case with MDE because of how many people have ripped them off over the years.",

If you're destitute then obviously not, but if its something you can afford without having to give up like heat/food/whatever then yeah as a one off you might as well.\nSomething i'd also say is that even if sex isn't really that meaningful by itself, the longer you go without success i feel like the lower your chances are of getting it naturally in the future without resorting to this. It is way easier for a guy that has fucked in the past 1-2 years to be confident and sleep with a chick, then for a guy who hasn't in 10 years, or if its his first time. You will definitely get some kind of confidence boost once you realise how easy and meaningless sex is to come by, rather than having it be this abstract and faraway notion you see everyone enjoying but don't get yourself",

He's just been told to go into the tank and bully people. That's all he's going to do. It's going to fall flat and not be that funny.\n\n2) Assuming Frank is smarter than he seems. He's been actively watching the show. He's in communication with Sam & Jet. He's had weeks to prepare. He's going to enter into the tank with some kind of new bit that no one was prepared for. All the Twitter posts about bullying people was a feint. Whatever he comes up with is going to end up being very funny.\n\nI am completely 50/50 on what will happen. I think either option is entirely possible. Sometimes Frank comes off as extremely dumb and very obvious. Other times he showcases a genuine intelligence and creativity for comedy. I'm not sure what the result will be.",

Seems like he got MINOR brownie points in the sorta lefty sphere that already accepted him (hasan, h3h3) but that Froggy video wasn't just him putting a hit on Sam, he threw a lot of people under the bus for apparently no reason other than \"m-my wife\". Also I think if he went about it a different way, people would've been more receptive to it but this was a man who said Nigger on the internet and created the whole \"e-celebs bashing other e-celebs\" genre, and he's crying about his wife. He can call it \"growth\", but to everyone around here it's pretty transparent as to why he shifted to borderline kid friendly nontent.",

His harassment of Boogie which took place over months and across multiple mediums was genius. From harassing him on Twitter, to calling him out in YouTube comments on his videos, to convincing him to go on podcasts together and then roasting him over video, etc. The whole thing was a masterclass in online harassment. Then he managed to bring the entire thing offline and delivered a coup de gr\u00e2ce by getting Boogie arrested. Afterwards he makes an online petition to give Boogie the death penalty which gets tens of thousands of signatures. The whole thing was a grand orchestration of hilarious trolling that zig-zagged back and forth between online and offline boundaries. I don't really know anyone else who has targeted an online e-celeb that big and managed to successfully troll them so hard they got them arrested. \n\nFrank will always be a legend for that even if a lot of his day to day activities are caveman-esque.",

That being said I think a lot of those big youtubers he's collab'd with might be having second thoughts about him. They'll put on a smile and get a paycheck but they know he's backstabbed people twice now - not a good look. His fan-base seems split 50/50 based on his last video. Between the people that still like him and people that have grown to hate him, I think there are also a lot of fans waiting for that \"redemption arc\" and the return of the prodigal son, but if he keeps fucking up that demographic will turn on him.\nDon't want to speculate on his personal life but I'll say this - I hear he got snipped and ain't having kids no more.

I have no doubt iDubbbz will be more financially succesful and have a bigger name than MDE but whatever he makes will not really stick onto the collective consciousness (you can make an argument that old iDubbbz did that for the YT sphere and that's fair, but his influence stops there).\nMDE's resurgence and WP2 on the other hand might fly just as high as the original, if not more, and whether or not it's financially successful or famous doesn't matter because everyone will still be copying whatever they come up with (again), and that extends way beyond YT/Twitch/social media and goes to the top of the entertainment industry",

MDE was positioned to dethrone SNL and late night in general; when Boomers were still in college or thereabouts SNL was and could be legitimately 'edgy' with the broadcast rules loosening with the time slot. That time was closed and signaled by Conan (an early Gen X-er) being done dirty. MDE was plenty popular enough for AS exec to want to do \"100 episodes\", and only curb stomped by Time Warner Vanguard/Blackrock type machinations further up the corporate feeding chain. Reality TV died somewhere along the way with scripting or hostile iDubbzy gotcha documentaries and mockumentaries of whomever They deem the enemy. Fish Tank is going back to basics in a way that recalls what was good of MTV to an extent as well (while being self-conscious/critical of it with the name, the metaphor, and Haneke Funny Games-ish structure). We shouldn't like this sort of thing, but there's curiosity about what your average Zoomer Doomer is like when we're all S2 Colonel Cambel AI'd into content and information ghettos in a stagnant culture led by gerontocrat Boomer Death Riders of the Apocalypse.",

I don't remember any bits in particular but she was mostly doing absurd mockery protests and gas lighting retards.\nThe only time she almost fucked up was when Venti, who was on 4chan and seeing people pointing out that she hard worked with MDE prior, name dropped her. I think she honestly stopped showing up after that.\n\n>>184456792\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvCBoiC0sHw&t=104s\nCompare the voices retarded, also people age in the span of over a decade.",
