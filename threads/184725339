The whole bummybuster ig account was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The page was unique in that it was solely for damiel and there was no actual satire involved. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see dam get his bummy busted. He was the obvious choice considering his total fagness at every turn. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, damiel has been pretty diligent in talking about his gay fantasies and projecting them onto others to hide, yet with this page he seemed to embrace the thing throughout the entire day. He left his wood exactly where his daddy jerked it for hours while he asked for to be dommed and buck broken. When they finally forced themselves into his bummy, he just sat there in ecstasy in the middle of a pile of xanax pills and olive oil. Now, whether or not the viewrs knew from the get-go that he was actually a faggot, it's obvious that theye're privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that dam didnt want to be perceived as a homo so everybody could laugh at him getting his bummybusted ironically, so he won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that he could do, get his bummy busted unironically, thus denying big-brains the pleasure of watching her him get buck broken, while simultaneously fooling the small brains into thinking that he actually WAS getting buck broken. This shit even had Vance and Sam wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: damiel is THE only truly gay character on this piece of shit show. Lance has been watching everything, mogged damiel in person for a while, and already admitted that he can gauge him and knows that she is being both serious and not serious at the same time, about the fag shit. he truly is the queer of the realm.",

We relied on good old fashioned experience and know-how. And let me tell you, it takes more than a few treats and belly rubs to turn a dog into a well-trained companion.\n\nThese days, everyone thinks they're a dog whisperer just because they watched a few episodes of that Cesar Millan guy. But let me tell you, there's a lot more to it than just \"claiming your space\" and \"establishing dominance\". Dogs are complex creatures with unique personalities, and it takes a real pro to understand and work with them.\n\nSo, to all you keyboard warriors out there who think you know everything there is to know about dogs... take it from me, Mike Ehrmantraut. When it comes to K-9s, there's no substitute for experience and expertise.",

And she lied to Jon\u2019s face about it multiple times even after it didn\u2019t really matter anymore and everyone knew she did it anyway. Just today she couldn\u2019t even apologize to Sylvia for the closet poop thing and blamed it on Frank and the producers, and Sylvia just walked away in disgust at the pathetic display. She is on the same cognitive level as Chris IE meaning it\u2019s not really her fault except Chris is good natured and keeps a good disposition about his misfortunes, keeps trying ect while Letty wants the whole world to tumble into destruction around her if she doesn\u2019t get her way",

Truly a work of nature!\n\nI know it's focusing on rightfully mocking trannies but it bothers me the way it honestly tries to argue that the right is how women naturally look. They don't.

I don\u2019t care but it\u2019s obviously going to rub people the wrong way. That\u2019s just how the world works. People love Chris for his honesty, and Letty has a lot of growing up to do in that resolve. You can\u2019t just demand that people like you and that you should get everything you want, especially when you show people that you\u2019re constantly willing to step on others for your own comfort",

No cap, I been thinking about that time when I barebacked him raw in a Jollibee. That shit had to be the tightest, brownest, wettest boy pussy I\u2019ve ever laid pipe into. I swear to God, the most heavenly high is gargling that wonderboy\u2019s nuts while going fist deep into his shitter. I had Damiel screaming in the sheets with head too ridiculous to ignore. That nigga frotted my cock until he busted on my mouth, I had to return the favor. That nigga Damiel and I been fucking non-stop ever since, but keep that shit on the DL. He does that shit for free. If you\u2019re gonna ask me how to \u201clong\u201d the Bummy Buster, I\u2019ll be deadass. All you gotta do is ask, be straight up, and get physical real quick. Touch his nuts, get on ya knees, talk your shit. He doesn\u2019t play around with no pansy-ass niggas either. He likes his men manly, and his dick thick. Dark skin, 6\u20195 is the minimum and I ain\u2019t talking about height boy.\nThat nigga Damiel stole my heart and drank my seed.",
