Either you can write or not, paying for school to make you each philosphy when you can just buy a philosphy book and learn through the internet for free.\nIf you are going to go to college choose a major that actually needs a degree and will secure you an internship. Use that technical degree to give you inspiration and knowledge to write. If you want, do writing as a minor.\nMost of my favorite authors were engineers and CS people so they could secure money, and only went full time writing when they were noticed.\nIt is absolutely not worth dumping everything into writing.

Right click the only entry that appears with the WS filter enabled\n(5.5. wait for the ws to receive more data if you want more than the initial loaded stuff, note this will steadily make your PC chug due to being resource intensive)\n6. Save all as HAR with content, filename should be www.fishtank.live.har\n7. Save the code from https://pastebin.com/3aw0E9s0 as index.js in the same folder as the HAR file is\n8. Run `node ./index.js` without the `s, it'll spit out a bunch of files\n\nTo get the most out of this it helps to know some basic scripting so you can do your own analysis.\nEven without that though it's kinda funny to browse the generated ttsAggregateByUser.json file and see what the biggest paypigs are saying.\n(eg. files catbox moe/5r7iz1.json)\n\nWARNING: do not frivolously share the HAR file or leftovers.json, they contain at a minimum your website login credentials",
