Big cities have many foreigners, but there's still large areas with basically 99% German demographics. \nOverall we have 6-7% Musels (as I like to call them) here. That's still tame compared to Muttland demographics but the future isn't really looking good either way since they outbreed the German family. 50 years and Germans will be a minority in the cities.\n\nThat's why I live in some backwater village anyway. None of that buzz annoys me here and I'm still in a big city within a 40 min car ride since this country is so small.",

I'm gonna' do the dolphin noise again *dolphin noises*\" unprompted in the cage challenge is the type of spergy little things my cousin would do to entertain herself.\ni'm aware shes still one of the more competent contestants despite her stimming, its clear as shes been coming more out of her shell that she's a pretty chill cool person with a good head on her shoulders, i just can't buy that she doesn't have SOMETHING up with her",
