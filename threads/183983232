Jason explicitly said he doesn\u2019t like her. & the tank agreed to conspire against her\n\nToday Damiel called her a bitch, told her she talks too much and to shut the fuck up when the white shark locked them in bedroom 3\n\nJosie told her if she had to pick between her & Damiel she would pick Damiel\n\nShe got heated when Jon start talking about sluts & mens rights\n\nAnd then she made her greatest blunder\n\nTesting Jon to see if he would give her a foot massage\n\nOnce he declined he went downstairs & told everyone about it\n\nthe change in their behavior was obvious. They were all creeped out\n\nVance even said \u201cthat is a desperate move. she did that because she\u2019s losing control. You see that right Jon?\u201d\n\nHer behavior ever since then has been off putting\n\nShe has no idea where to go because she can sense everyone distancing themselves from her\n\nHer BPD is gonna fire on all cylinders if she\u2019s confident that everyone is against her\n\nWill she get more desperate or can she find a strategy to avoid elimination?",

Vance 100% knew of he wasn't the last one to leave in that TTS room challenge that she'd keep it for herself. Hell notice how she didn't even try to correct the hot dog stuff until someone called her out. There's very little \"manipulation\" regarding this whole thing. The only one manipulative in all this is Letty, who basically set this up for herself. You're a simp or a moron if you don't see this. Think anyone would be reacting this way if she didn't self insert all the time, talk all the time, talk about how she wants to eat shit, pisses in closets, confronts people constantly if she wasn't thinking she was a \"Puppet Master\". If anything Sam called her out for basically being female idubbz and the rest of the tank now felt comfortable with just opening up their pent up resentment for this woman who's been a pain in everyone's fucking neck.",

They're victims of circumstances they couldn't control (usually absent fathers) and they genuinely don't know what they're doing. They need guidance and acceptance and, generally speaking, no man will give that to them because they will either notice the manipulation or feel spurned by it instead of accepting that they need help. They aren't owed an actual relationship, but it would be nice if people gently guided them toward normalcy more often. Most people don't have the capacity to do that, though.\n\n>>183984371\nWhite women who cheat on you aren't the same as black people who destroy local businesses, but nice try.",

Most of them are just decent people who are fucked in the head and instinctively manipulate people due to trauma. I have spent most of my life abusing and being abused by these chicks and I still don't hate any of them. Mostly because they don't really do anything destructive to society at large. Unlike niggers.\n\n>>183984554\nMurderers and drug dealers are net negatives on society. You're projecting your insecurities on a 20-something mentally ill female who shows her gross pussy online for free. She's not really doing all that much to destroy western civilization. BPD girls are a symptom of a greater societal problem and are victims of that problem. Certain drug dealers and murderers may also be victims the same, but these people will always exist and deserve to be removed from society. A girl being a basket case because her dad molested her does not. I genuinely believe most people protesting to this are just scared of girls. Not even women, just girls. You're fags.",

To be \"traumatized\" by them is seriously the gayest thing I can ever imagine. Once you learn the signs it's up to you to decide what to do, but yes, no one owes them anything. However, most of the hate comes from a place of either insecurity or fear. BPD girls will cheat on you, hit you, break your shit. If this bothers you given that it is a demonstrable phenomenon among certain women, you are a genuine homosexual. It's your job to identify it and either mitigate it or get the fuck out, considering it seems to always be caused by other men (their fathers). It can be a traumatic experience the first time, but to blame a fucking female with mental illness - again, a female, who can barely do anything - is just pathetic.\n\n>>183984755\nNot a simp, just known enough of these girls to know they can be very good people despite their insanity, and the hate bothers me insofar as it clearly comes mostly from a place of seething.

He actually puts effort into things despite limited capability while everyone else puts no effort into everything despite being more capable. \n\nHe's getting more energy out by working out and occasionally training. He's getting more comfortable around other people. He's probably never had real friends before and it's hard for him to moderate himself or behave properly in those situations. Contrast how he behaves socially with the group compared to when he's talking to a cast member, it's totally different. Jon making some friends, even if they were forced to be around him, could be a huge step for him.\n\nUnless he's faking it and this is a guy who just has a great retard act",

What you said is completely unrelated to the point of my post.\nI used to like watching Frank a lot more but he squandered his momentum. 4 video in a whole year lmao. Seems like he should've changed his format. He could've done anything.\nI suspect he's losing lots of subs and, as you mentioned, Sam's doing him a solid giving him more exposure.",
