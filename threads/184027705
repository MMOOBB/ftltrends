It's not her fault they fucking bought shitty equipment for an idea Jet stole from here. When you've been reacting to sound your whole life, it's hard to not react to it if you're not actually deaf.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, deaf people can feel the vibrations from sound. Why do you think deaf people can still enjoy music?",

Previously they brought on a incoherent, rambling Greek midget called Nick Caminos to give everyone one on one financial advice. After Vance's interview with him they told him that he offended Nick and that had to write an apology letter (he did). Meanwhile, they've been gaslighting everyone else into thinking that Nick is a spoiled rich kick whose dad's money is paying for the show, and that Vance's behaviour jeopardised that. In the middle of Vance's schizo bit they brought Nick back in and had him tell Vance that he wasn't putting in enough effort, that he was ruining the show and that he was really disappointed in him. Vance bought it and was on the verge of tears. He's now forced to turned up his shitty schizo acting to 11 and lean into the \"I can't believe I'm ruining the show\" thing, all the while actually being legitimately concerned that he's ruining the show.",

Kudos to the major's design, i love her androgynous face that resembles (at least to me) some depictions of Goemon (the historical japanese thief). \nOn the other hand i thought the plot was hard to follow. Lots of political gibberish (i could see a little bit of MGS here and there, kojima knows his classics).\nIt's not a bad thing, it was just a bit complicated to me. It adds to the credibility of the plot, and it shows how the writers did give a shit. I might watch the movie a second time to get it all.\nI loved it.",
