Guy literally did nothing wrong and there was nothing to even remotely incriminate him and his book EXPLICITLY said you cannot date people under 18.\n\nSam did it because he could. Because he's an insecure faggot and just showed what he does when he gets a shred of power and control. He abuses it and makes a circus show and public humiliation to kick someone out over nothing. \n\nHe is a washed out loser with a bunch of stupid mutt zoomers like Jet worshipping him and burned all bridges and any mainstream career he could ever get and the only girl he could score was a bipolar crazy /r9k/ roastie who previously was fucking drug dealers and dogs.",

So many people give credit to Mauro for the fight but he literally went and moaned to Sylvia about Jon who then actually went and did something about it. If Sylvia didn't turn into mama bear and stomp up those stairs nothing would have happened.\n\nEven during the screaming match Mauro was just San Andreas NPC emoting while calling Jon retarded over and over and that he smells. It was pretty funny but at least Sylvia was on the actual topic of Jon's kidnapping attempt.",

The Swatting and them having access to their phones was the first major knockdown, but it was able to carry on, the second was Damiel blatantly being a Plant, getting Buck broken by John, seething so hard about it he ran to his room, pulled out his phone popped a couple of pills and was kicked off for a day, only to come back and the only person who seemed to care in the slightest was Josie, then Vance privately later behind closed doors. \nSimmons thing absolutely could have been handled better but I understand it all for comedic affect Sam saw this guy as having cost him money so wanted to use him to get his money's worth. \nMauro leaving is regrettable, but the guy wasn't really cut out for this show since the trailer dropped and we all saw him.",

She was the actual fucking one that did that.\nThen she also tries to convince Jon that Simmons was trying to groom him, when Simmons was always on the level with Jon and if anything is a case of 1 retard trying to groom another retard.\n\nThe end conclusion is she was jealous of Simmons (an autistic ESL) stealing Jon's attention (a violent retard).",
