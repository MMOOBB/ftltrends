I think every guy does that in his life, you get the ruler out and then you look it up and it's like, \"Oh, wow, mine's below average, \"what the fuck, god damn it.\" And to be honest, I had massive insecurity about that. There's an inevitable time when you hang out with a girl and you met her a couple of years ago, she's your girlfriend, or you just met her, and you whip it out,\nand before you made jokes like, \"Yeah, I have a tiny dick,\" and the girl's like, \"Oh, it must be huge.\" You know like how in porn, it usually plops out, like foop, and for you, it's just like, \"Oh, it's here,\" but I've never heard any complaints. The best compliments I've ever gotten was by multiple girls like, \"You know what's funny? \"You don't even have a\nbig dick, \"but it was still really good.\" And as a guy, you're like, \"Is that good or bad? \"I don't even know how to take that, but I'm getting\nsidetracked.\nThis on twitter \nWhere does this come from from simmons",
