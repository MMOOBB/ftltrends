Then kept them and the audience in the dark (about these contestants, and the contestants about what the show was called and what it was about) until they were in the house so they'd have no idea. Also could have got someone like Erick Hayden to be the host since he's a lot less recognizable than Sam. They could have got a hotter, raunchier cast in this way that would be clueless about Sam Hyde and MDE. \n\nAlso they should have thought out how they would torture the contestants (without going overboard) and had more so they could stand to lose a few earlier.",

The \"malicious\" observers are being given a type of reckoning. This is further outlined in the Sylvia \"dream substance\" channel song titles \"Emotional Labor\" this act of redefining permissible entertainment \"Ego Rehabilitation\" the overall \"dressing down\" of Sam Hyde viewers being mocked and \"worked\" into a malleable headspace and finally \"Harsh Punishment\" a thinly veiled psychological threat evoking past transgressions as for why these events are happening. Finally the About page simply says \"Social Experiment\" tying into the greater theme of the Sam Hyde Three Letter Agency intelligence asset narrative and more famously Sam Hyde's \"Digital House Arrest\".\n\nI love you Sam.",
