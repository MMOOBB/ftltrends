This is a guy who thinks he is really cool and he just needs time, any day now he will succeed, any day now I will be doing something cool. He stalls and does nothing until it's too late. He is playing the Fishtank long game but it's already 1 week and he could be removed right now.\nHe thinks he will pop off one day but he is already balding and getting old. I think he said he is going to have children in 5 years or so. Everything with this guy is ''I'll do it later, just give it time'' and the time never comes. His gf will be over 30 years old and possibly barren in 5 years.\nThe Vancecoin is buying a cheap worthless coin and then waiting for the big boom to sell all your Vancecoins, and it never goes up in value. You hold onto your Vancecoins for so long that they stop getting used.",

So what we came across that day on the woods was obviously unplanned and the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down, and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't, and for that from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to cum to the internet, I want to cum to anyone who's seen the video, I want to cum to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But, most importantly, I want to cum to the victim and his family. For, my fans, who are defending my actions, please don't, they do not deserve to be defended. The goal of my content is always to entertain, to push the boundaries, to be all inclusive and in the world I live in I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said, I made a huge mistake, I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm just here to cum. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm disappointed in myself, and I promise to be better. I will be better, thank you.\nObviously he is the plant",
