This has so much potential to be kino, and I'd hate for a version where everything went wrong or a watered down Twitch rip off done by Ludwig or some other normie streamer be the only legacy.",

Sam Hyde is ok with fucking 16 year old girls. No one cares. People have been trying to cancel him for years for this and his fanbase just doesn't care because everyone agrees with him.\nThen when someone else does anything even related to teenagers they clutch their pearls\n>umm did you say you should wait for a girl to be 18? GROOMER\n>did you le heckin put the caption ''sexylegs'' on this comedy video where a little girl is wearing is wearing large pants up to her neck?\n>umm... kind of sus bro how you wrote a book where you even noticed that teenagers form relationships\n>you told people to not rape girls? what's so pedo dude\nWhen you bring up to these people that Sam Hyde has done and said more damning things than Simmons they just do a 180 and say it's ok because it's legal and BASED actually. Then they go back to attacking a guy who didn't have sex with anyone underage.\n\nWhat makes these lunatics like this? They could have just removed Simmons normally. Simmons didn't have immunity and he lost the challenge. This was fine, just get him out of there with no drama. Sam Hyde ruined the show and it wasn't even in the moment, they planned this out by getting the karaoke out hours ahead so they could reference his post about his biggest fear being people laughing at him during karaoke. Sam Hyde had time to plan how he is going to accuse Simmons of pedophilia and ruin his life, when he himself had sex with a 15/16 year old and defended pedophilia around the same time Simmons wrote about how you shouldn't have sex with kids.\nAll of this could have been avoided. I don't understand why these freaks are like this.",
