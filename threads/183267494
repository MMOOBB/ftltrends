I watched enough to pick up pieces here and there and im sure he\u2019s a closeted homosexual. Not that it matters. Its just funny. I wonder if he ever finds the courage to come out. Who knows, maybe he\u2019s already fucking men behind closed doors. It wouldn\u2019t suprise me. \nIm kinda sad his new content is so shitty but atleast his obnoxious zoomer fans seem to like it.",

Have a contest and whoever wins decides what will be on tv non-stop with no way to change it or turn it off, and it has to be one specific thing. If Jon wins he puts on 24/7 Andrew Tate videos. Josie wins and puts the entire MLP show on tv.\nAnd it has to be a specific thing. You can't just say ''put horror movies on tv,'' if you want horror movies you name a movie. You name Friday the 13 and all the Friday the 13 movies play on tv 24/7 in a loop. If you try to trick the system and be clever the showrunners do a monkey paw move and make sure you regret your choice.",
