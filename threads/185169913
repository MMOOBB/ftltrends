As the chairman, it is my utmost pleasure to announce on behalf of /tv/'s Official Arbitrary Numerical Dick-measuring of Success Board that the 24/7 live-streaming interactive internet show Fish Tank Live has crossed the threshold of 900 discussion threads within only 34 days of the show's commencement! This is a surefire indicator of the popularity and success of the show.\nIt is hereby ordered by official decree of /tv/'s OANDSB that all seething Discord trannies, blockheads, Jews, Tim Heidecker, Mrs. and Mr. Anisa Jomha, poorfags, manlets, and women (who don't belong on the internet anyway) shall immediately cease -- oh, wait a minute! What's this? Hmm. I see...\nI regret to inform you that the above message was given in error. I have just been handed an updated memorandum by the Board, and it appears the criteria of success for a 24/7 livestreaming interactive internet show (in the genre of heckhouse, porno, or torturearium) has been amended and has taken effect immediately prior to this announcement.\nThe ACTUAL threshold of success is NOT nine hundred (900) threads... rather, it is one thousand (1,000) threads. I solemnly apologize to /ftl/, Jet Neptune, and Sam Hyde for getting your hopes up, but the show is NOT yet declared a success. In fact, as of right now, this show is an absolute garbage fire of a failure, like everything nazi pedophile Scam Hyde does.",

Even if they decide you committed fraud and owe them money you can still keep getting money from them, they just take a small percentage off the amount you get each month and that goes towards paying them back. she might get kicked off for a few months but once her bank account is empty and she has no income they'll let her on again\n\nt. former NEET in Canada",

Whereas Letty's drama usually builds up through out the day, sometimes even relating back to previous days, and would require much more explanation. Most people don't have the time to watch all day so they rely on other sources to give them a qrd. It's no surprise that those who do watch a lot of Fishtank, don't see Letty in such a bad light compared to those who don't. The waifu wars also doesn't help her case and the whole Jeremy shit. \n\nEither way, Letty is not as bad as she's made out to be, but she's not the perfect little princess others call her as well.",
