                "comment": "I watched Fishtank and followed threads here every waking hour for 6 days (stopped after night of Damiel getting kicked out).\n\nHere's my final thoughts on contestants:\n\nVioletta - I really disliked her from the start but over the time I've grown to like her. Anons keep saying she's a social chameleon with not real believes on her own. But if you were a true gender-realist you would know that's how almost all women are, even when they claim they are not. Letty being proficient in it shows her intelligence or female intuition. Women molding to their partners worldview is natural. Unfortunately she molded to some crazy discord berniebro coomers. \n\nVance - coward. During the late night sleepover couch talk after the crazy sketches, they were discussing \"eating foreskin\" - Js using teeth to circumcise babies. Vance barely backed up Letta saying that it really happens, and when others pressed him to elaborate he backes down \"just google it after the show\". Same with Jon, when spilling redpills all the time, Vance just sits silently despite himself being the most redpilled on his own twitter which he didn't even scrub. When Jon keep telling some conspiracy stories which are almost true but not quite, it's spineless for Vance to not correct them, to stay silent and let others mock or attack inaccuracies.\n\nJon - I disliked him a lot at first, now he's my favorite. It's inspiring how his pure honesty and just being a Real Human Being had BTFOd Damiel. Don't pretend you're someone you're not. Be truthful, meaning don't knowingly say things you know to be lies, and just believe this will bring the best outcome. Autism is a superpower in this context.\n \nDamiel - I don't get how anyone could enjoy chimp behavior like showing ass and balls live on youtube stream and literally pretending to be monkey on a kitchen table with food or smushing full plate of pancakes with a fist. Embarrassing middle-schooler humor. \n\nNot much to say about other contestants that hasn't been said before.",

They see a quiet autistic girl and think ''I could win her over, she'd be mine for sure''. this is caused by the fact that she doesnt know about them but they see her 24/7 and thus assume she isnt revolted by them as she's clearly still around\n\nIf these fags were capable of getting a girl like Josie, they would've done it already. But she's got the alure of ''this could be easy, if only we werent seperated by thousands of miles''",

Josie goes about her business unfazed by petty drama or gossip but still shows genuine interest in what people are doing like Vance's drumming and her copying Jon's uppercuts with Goldstriker. She is pleased by the simple things in a pure way. She just seems like a joy to be around in contrast with all the other vampires out there like letty who walked into Jon and Simmons conversations, sat on the bed and went \"Woops am I interuppting teehee :3 oh my gawddd \", jealous of anyone else getting attention and always having to insert herself into people's conversation so she can gossip about it later. The two of them represent polar opposites, with Josie's online presence being videos with her family, anime keychains, and newgrounds while Letty's being sharing nudes with mentally unstable guys and Sylvia selling nudes on onlyfans. The best part is letty became keenly aware of Josie being the fan favorite and you can see it festering in her rotten brain with how she's trying so hard to seduce the guys with her bewitching demeanor but absolutely none of them are phased by it",
