There was a 50/50% debate about whether or not it was a good idea to kick him and/or the manner in which it was done was appropriate.\n\nAll the naysayers were saying \"hurrdurr not even a week and 2 fish gone it's all over\" and the show did some quick fixes to stop the bleeding. Then the naysayers got pissed at that and pivoted to \"hurrdurr can't even TTS what u wanna say enjoy paying 50 Dollars for a TTS\" \"can't even use fishtoys lul\"\n\nThen yesterday mods eased up on TTS censorship, took 50% off, enabled fishtoys, and they were being used literally all day long. Peaked at 25k+ viewers yesterday from what I saw last night. Was probably more. Josie fans bought her alone like 5 plushies and took her bed away which translates into somewhere in the realm of 2900 dollars profit for the show in one day from one fish alone.\n\nNot to mention the constant TTS barrage and how many people are shilling out for those.\n\nWhats the next cope gonna be from you fags? Because it seems like youre just concern trolling and just want the show to fail instead of offering any valid criticism",

The only thing that could be construed as damaging from a twitter freak perspective is that you can't advocate for waiting for a girl to be 18. That right now is considered grooming and will get you cancelled. I don't agree with it, but that's how it is on twitter.\nIf the worst thing Simmons is being accused of is advocating for grooming 17 year olds then I will talk about Sam Hyde grooming a 15 year old and having sex with a 16 year old.",

                "comment": ">>183877148\nBy my standards talking to a 15 year old and waiting for her to be 16 while you're almost 30 is the only thing weird about this entire situation. I don't consider it criminal if you waited for a girl to be of legal age and the legal age is 16.\nWhile I think what Sam Hyde did is creepy it's not something I would cancel him over and I've known this for 10 years and never had a problem with it. I only have an issue with it now because Sam Hyde of all people is leading pedo witch hunts against people who are far less guilty than him.\nIf Simmons had done what Sam Hyde did he would be fucking done professionally. To me it's insane that someone who has been treated as badly as Sam Hyde would do this to people. This is a guy who has been cancelled, blacklisted from the industry, he has entire discord dedicated to trying to ruin him and the Marky allegations have been following him for 10 years, yet he decides to ruin a guy's life over something this minor.",

Neither talked to him for the longest time. Nick only started back up with him when Sam would pay him. It's not a secret Charls hates him. WP2 doesn't change any of these facts. Idk if Nick made up with him but Charls surely still hates him.",
