The sound effects are being met with varying degrees of reception. Honestly, it\u2019s just another byproduct of a half baked product they thought they could produce by the seat of their pants. As everyone has already pointed out: rules, challenges, prizes, audience participation\u2026 everything should\u2019ve been planned out better. It\u2019s not that the game can\u2019t change, it\u2019s that it can\u2019t continuously be changing every single day. Somethings have to stay constant. Is there or is there not elimination challenges? Can you or can you not opt out of challenges? Can you take a break from the production if you are upset? Are the audience and contestants allowed to spill the beans on secrets?\nAll this shit has fluctuated day by day. I think after the Simmons incident, everyone is becoming increasingly aware both in and out of the house that the contestants are being coddled a bit too much for everyone\u2019s liking. Honestly, and I hate to say this, I feel like after Simmons they should\u2019ve just kept the price Shawn and maybe have the show fold within two weeks. At least it would\u2019ve been more interesting and closer to the original spirit of the show in the way it was advertised.",

Jon has a habit of asking really direct questions to people that seem out of place. \n\nHe did it to Simmons first asking about camp, the ages of campers, what state it was in etc. After the Simmons thing started coming out go back and watch how Jon kept pressing him on it.\n\nLater, Jon had a very bizarre conversation with Vance about the contracts for the show. Following that, Jason was talking to Vance talking about how the \"imposter\" or \"plant\" can't win the show.\nThey probably got Vance to be on the show by telling him it's like an audition. I don't think they would actually use this unfunny retard as a legitimate \"plant\", but I do suspect he's had some previous contact with Jet and is being \"directed\" in some capacity.\n\n>>183990721\nHe's starting to spend long stretches alone in his room performing for his \"fans\". These performances are going to grow more and more unhinged and uncomfortable as time goes on. Quote me on this.",

Instead I become a grifter for lost males and red pilled loser ideology. I have no friends in real life, only orbiters and people that I have to pay to hang out with me. I can't find functional women in real life to date so I have sex with 16 year olds. Nothing I do is funny and I will never be funny, I can't write anything funny and everything I have made that is funny is done by someone else. If I see a chance to short change someone I will.
