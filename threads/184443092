Simon and Fatty roasted them, Fatty won fishbucks for winning the roast. Milkman showed up singing a song about finding clues. Fish are now looking for 3 digit number codes to unlock the padlocks keeping them chained. The entire chain thing is probably not a real challenge and just gaslighting (yet again).",
