I thought for the first few days that the jokerposting about Neptune being incompetent was just jannies, but with how obviously little planning has actually gone into the show and this I'm starting to believe.\n\nHow did they not have an entire itinerary of things to do to the fish for the whole of the 6 weeks before the show started? How was TTS so fucking broken and obviously not tested properly? How were contestants NOT background checked properly? How was the website a total hot mess that cost them a fuckload to put back up?
