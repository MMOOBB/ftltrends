The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Jet's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from rap music videos, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Jet truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Jet's existential catchphrase \"Can I get paid yet?,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Sam Hyde's epic livestreams. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jet's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Jet tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also The Drone Bit's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - its main component draws heavily from aerodynamics, for instance. Real MDE fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Drone Bit truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in The Drone Bit's existencial catchphrase \"BZZZZZZT,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to the disastrous first flight of the Wright Brothers. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jet Neptune's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Fishtank.Live tattoo, fully featuring The Drone Bit. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",
