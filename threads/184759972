And in the bathroom cam she keeps saying that she actually means it when she says \"thank you\" but she sounds like she's being ironic and that she doesn't know how to show some emotions. The best example of her voice not being so supressed and showing emotion, in my example, is when she was thanking chat while on bed a week ago, though it's still her kind of monotonous voice.",
