Also it's sad how by just posting a facebook photo or an instagram story they'll just get easily dozens of guys willing to fuck, that makes rebounding and forgetting extremely easy for them.\nDon't get me wrong, it's toxic AF, but the constant jealousy, the reconciliations, the games, it really feels like you live for her, it's a constant battle for trying to win her back, that makes you be constantly thinking of girls like that, they poison your mind.",

That's why he has \"mentors\", why he follows Tate, why he exercises, why he says he has businesses, why he says he has 2-3 children and why he says he has a wife-gf.
