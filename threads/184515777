                "comment": "I was trying to sleep, but started thinking about some shit. The whole letty-building-a-table challenge was fucking with me, and it seems to have a lot of people confused. The challenge was unique in that it was solely for Letty and there was no actual prize involved. There was a poll taken and the chat wanted to see Letty build a table. She was the obvious choice considering her total incompetence at any practical mundane task. Alright, makes sense. But, hitherto, Letty has been pretty diligent in trying her best to win each challenge and taking them seriously, yet with this challenge she seemed to sandbag the thing throughout the entire day. She left the wood exactly where Jet dropped it for hours while she asked for legendary tools like wood salt and heat nails. When they finally forced her to work on it, she just sat there trying to saw a 2x4 with a fucking steak knife and olive oil. Now, whether or not Letty knew from the get-go that people were fucking with her, it's obvious that she was privy to it. So what's the deal with the whole thing? My best guess is that Letty perceived that the entire challenge was just so that everybody could laugh at her trying to build a table, which she obviously cannot do, so she won one over on everybody by doing the only thing that she could do, not even try, thus denying big-brains the pleasure of watching her fail while simultaneously fooling the small brains into thinking that she actually WAS trying and failing. This shit even had Vance and Sam wondering what was real and what wasn't. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Letty is THE only truly interesting character on this piece of shit show. Ella has been watching everything, talked with Letty in person for a while, and already admitted that she can't gauge her and thinks that she is being both serious and not serious at the same time. She truly is the queen of the realm.",

If she actually had \"verbal tai chi\" then she would be well liked in the house and would have avoided most of the conflicts. Her \"sheer force of will\" is something akin to a retard running through a dense brush instead of taking the clear path right next to it.",

Authenticity beats inauthenticity, it's a counter. An authentic, self-aware person who has investigated themselves thoroughly is the most difficult to manipulate socially by someone like Letty because social manipulation is about telling someone who they are. A person who knows who and what they are already is safe. I suspect Josie is like this, most of her energy is directed inward not out, she doesn't look to others to tell her who she is.

They had no idea if those 'alliances' were necessary or a good idea. Especially because of how arbitrary the eliminations and rewards can be. At mr. Goldstriker's whim.",

The staff absolutely hates her, Sam being the most obvious example. I'm not even sure if the Damiel freak outs were totally genuine, given that he was the plant and called himself a \"great actor\", although he obviously didn't like her either.\n\nThere has been a slight increase in affection for her but that has largely been because she provides entertainment, and also the fact that familiarity actually breeds affection and not contempt.
