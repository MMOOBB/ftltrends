The reason he never says or does anything for vast swathes of the day is because he's planning his next epic move that'll garner tons of upboats and be clipped and shared everywhere. EVERY SINGLE TIME that shit falls completely flat. He's the fish that thinks the most about his actions to an excruciating degree and obviously cares about what the viewers think of him the most. The worst part is I'm pretty sure he thinks he's winning the show and must have the most fans. I bet in his head he's imagining his Vance Pill video has the most views out of all the fish tank content and his le epic baby stealing move he just did is gonna secure his status at the top.\n\nHe has no fucking idea he's universally hated for the way he's living in the tank. The way he's playing the game should actually get him kicked out. Even fucking DAMIEL who's the plant understands the point of the show is not to be constantly trying to meta-game your actions and telegraph everything to impress the audience. The point is to just exist alongside the other fishes and the content develops organically. EVERYONE ELSE understands this EXCEPT VANCE.\n\nFUCK THIS NIGGER GET HIM OUT OF HERE.",
