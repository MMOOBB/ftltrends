If you're living with someone you don't like for 6 weeks you got to put up with it. It's clear that Damiel and Sylvia hate her the most. Damiel shit talks her every chance he gets. The thing I can think of Letty doing to Josie that was bad was going back on her word when they were in the cell challenge. Oh and not cleaning. But Damiel and Sylvia barely clean too so. Idk how you can accuse Letty of being manipulative when Vance has been playing all sides since like day 1",

Her best bet is to setup a discord or something for people thst actually think she's cool to hang out, and filter out the psycho simps (which would probably happen straight away). There's probably a zero chance of this happening though. I saw some other chan that was legitimately trying to dox her and her family so it's not looking good.\n> Also probably not going to that d&b anymore lmao\nDefinitely not. I have no idea why she mentioned it out loud to the chat. Either she figures we've all seen her twitter or she's very, very naive to the level of psycho that is awaiting her.",

Then you realize at the end of the day, they're all still people. All of them are in their 20s, no real direction in life, all of which signed up because 10k is a decent chunk of money for them because they're all unemployed people. Sam in the last few years have tried to give advice to a younger generation these last few years so I think he's grown sympathetic to lost young adults who feel demoralized.\nI honestly think this whole thing is like some Willy Wonka test. Like the most virtuous person ends up being the winner. Notice they only turned the Slyvia TTS filter off after she made a ass of herself for no reason and blew up at Letty.",
