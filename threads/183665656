It should go without saying that it is working against itself. Who the fuck is going to resonate with this? All this says to me is: \"I'm a faggot who wants to program children in demonic ways and /I/ hate Sam Hyde!!!\" which effectively demolishes your credibility. The schools are tax-funded specifically to educate children. Not indoctrinate them. Sam Hyde is an internet comedian who makes funny videos funded by willing donators.

In my experience it's very hard to calculate cloud infrastructure costs ahead of time if you don't have a good estimate for how much traffic you're going to get. They didn't even give the infrastructure a public test before launch, so I can't imagine what they based their usage estimates on.",

Unfortunately that's beyond rare for an interior wall like that. It'll be a flat or low-sheen, hard to tell exactly from video quality but either way; you're not cleaning that without a noticeable mark remaining. The actual act of cleaning itself would do more damage than just leaving. Friction from whatever cloth used will abrase the wall, making it noticeably shiny in patches.",

Especially if the paintjob itself is less than a year old. Though in this case, that advantage is negligible because of how small the wall is to begin with. It's an extra 2 minutes of labor and you should always have more paint than you need for any job no matter how small.",
