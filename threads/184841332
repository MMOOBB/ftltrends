Is a cutter, stimms to not rip out her hair, fetishizes white cock because subconsciously she wants to escape poverty. Also fetishizes break guy's hearts. has plenty of friends and goes to conventions so the femcel act is a lie. Also really likes nigger culture and probably would hate all her neet fanbase if she met them in real life.\n>Letty, looks horrendous in her early 20's. Also has toxic traits that will guarantee a psycho will stalk her out of revenge (happened twice.) Has a fucked up leg that's longer than the other one, has a fucked up eye. She gets off to manipulation as evidenced by her exes and by her actions in the tank. Also gets off from making people mad and/or being yelled at in small doses (Damiel proves this limit). Also enjoys trying to sissfy and demean men. Doesn't know how to do basic self care because her parents do it for her. Is a drug addict and a discord neet. Has anorexia. She rarely shits because of ensure (low calorie liquid meal for elderly people.) so she is fascinated with poop due to the infrequency. (Piss fetish unconfirmed due to it being a meme and could be leaning into it.) Has a hairy beaver and gives boring head. Is also a cutter.\n>Sylvia is fat but worst of all, she's boring. She was blacked, used to be addicted to drugs. Is thin skinned. Is a hypocrite. Is willing to be as nasty (almost certainly wiped her ass with Lettie's clothes). Shit talks everyone behind their backs (everyone does this but she's the worst offender of it ) Has gone to jail more than once this year alone. Has an OF so she sells her body to weirdos for money. Looks ridiculous in her outfits and her makeup makes her looks like a clown. Essentially white trash. Is probably a cutter. Is on antipsychotics and is essentially crazy. Also has shitty tats.\n\nPeople really have waifu wars over these girls? I'm disappointed /tv/..",

Letty is the 'smartest' as compared to her fishtank mates imo, based on her ability to work out complex thoughts and verbalize them, and come up with unique solutions to working out conflict with others.",

This kind of studying and prep is way fresher in her mind than anyone else. Getting back into school/learning/testing is not a simple process to do like a lot of people think, kek. Take a few years off after high school then try getting back into it. That stuff leaves you really fast if you aren't in a situation where you're using it regularly. Especially math and algebra.",
