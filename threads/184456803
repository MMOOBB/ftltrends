Sam selected the spergiest contestants he could find thinking that they would cause the most drama but instead the fish have turned out to be likable and much less cynical than the crew. The crew assumed wrongly that spergy internet zoomers would be inherently bad people that deserve to be made fun of and instead they have now grown to like them. Every attempt to gaslight them falls flat and most of the enjoyable content comes from the fish themselves (Jontent, Josie being cute, Letty scat queen saga, etc.). The abortion debate and ankle chains fell completely flat because the fish are actually smarter that the retards in the basement that come up with the challenges.",

So Dani was a fake name used for that character. Danny Bates the girl from that early MDE sketch is a totally different person considering that's her real name. Their facial structures are kind of similar but their ages don't match up at all. Carolines Instagram goes all the way back to 2012 and she seems to be a teenager around then, in 2010 she would have been like 13 years old. Danny Bates is obviously in her 20's in that video from 2010 and was likely someone Sam knew from RISD.\n\nGood theory they're the same person and have known Sam forever but it doesn't match up at all.",

Doing this on the dl only to take the fight on short notice would be the best play. Sam's Foreman cross guard and framing won't save him from 8 years less abuse on a better physique that doesn't sit there and let himself be leaned on -- he has zero lateral movement and cannot slip to save his life (much less haymakers from men nearly a foot shorter like Thompson).

A negative TTS goes through, she laughs, they mention guro art a few times, she laughs. They call her a asshole alcoholic, she plays along. Everyone else has shown weakness and once they know it, they dig in. Josie hasn't really shown all that much short of the plushies. It's not like Letty who kept nagging people about how attractive she is or isn't or Slyvia whining about the fat or BBC thing. Josie hasn't exposed any weak point to the audience or the producers so far. Her and Vance both have this thing going for them, the surface level insults kinda roll across them like water as they haven't shown that they take anything super personal unlike the other people so far.",

Her and Vance both have this thing going for them, the surface level insults kinda roll across them like water as they haven't shown that they take anything super personal unlike the other people so far.\nHer weak point will be TTS bringing up stuff she obviously wants to keep private. AFAIC, anything \"instagram\" is out as it has been plugged on her bio.\nShe is as of yet unaware that thewayback machine crawled her entire twitter from 2018-2022. The stuff in there, from what I have seen, she would rather probably not have anybody know about. Insults bounce off of her easily, however we've seen she bottles up pretty quickly when unexpected things occur, so the only true way to fuck with Josie it to get inside her head like this.\nOf course, this is all moot because the TTS jannys would never allow anything like this through without it being very esoteric.",
