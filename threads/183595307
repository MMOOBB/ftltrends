You need to let them leave them alone to get settled and start to form cliques and alliances. They form a sense of safety thinking that the sharks aren't actively fucking with them behind the scenes. Then when the sharks actually do fuck with them, they will start infighting and immediately blame each other. \nIt's like the toilet paper in the bin - they immediately stared blaming each other and didn't for a second think it was the sharks. You have to build up to this stuff. \n\nAlso if you made life living hell from day 1 they would all quit. If you make life living hell when they're close to the end, they're more likely to endure.",

I think someone not speaking (mauro, silvia) makes them dislikable, but simmons is dislikable and he speaks a lot. I could say similar about the others. I noticed that when Jon and Josie were in the kitchen either alone or with one other person and started cleaning up or cooking it made me like them more. I think if you watch someone focussing on something good or even just enjoying themselves then it humanises that person and makes them likable. It's interesting.\nI wish there were more comprehensive summaries of the days going by on youtube, I can't really keep up with everything but what I catch is enjoyable. I hope if a full documentary is made then it's hours long to cover all of the interesting stuff but I guess missing things is the nature of live shows.\nHas the secret challenge finished? Have the two people doing it been guessed/revealed? My guess this whole time was that there was no secret challenge the whole thing was just to confuse people.\nI know there were financial issues and I hope Sam Hyde wasn't too screwed over, it sounded like he would have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more than he expected which would hurt but hopefully there are enough fans to fund it so that it's financially worth it for him.",

It depends where you want to go in cybersecurity (blue team, red team, engineering, architecture, governance etc), but the most important thing you can do is work on your own projects and build a portfolio. It's the one field where you actually don't need contacts to get a job. If you're not a sociable person, channel all your energy into projects at home, and make something out of them. \nIf you want to get into blue teaming, set up your own lab and start digging through logs. Simulate attacks against it and come up with ways of detecting said attack. Write queries in Microsoft's free Microsoft Sentinel trial (a lot of big organisations are moving to Sentinel for their SIEM, so having experience here will demonstrate a lot). Take the queries you wrote and add it to your github. Even if it's basic shit like checking for sign in failures. \nIf you are aiming to get into red teaming, build a lab in AWS or Azure (you can do this for free) then spin up a Kali box and go to town hacking it. Document what you're doing and put it on your github. \n\nAlso keep up to date with news. Read about breaches and how they transpired. If you have even a fraction of this under your belt applying for an entry-level job, you will be significantly beyond 99.9% of people. \nt. am currently recruiting for 2 roles at the firm I work at and can't find anyone with a shred of actual passion.",
