Then someone comes out of the basement and takes one person away to discuss something off camera. It's very fucking gay.\nJon should have been dragged out of the bathroom and grilled in front of everyone.\n>b-but muh challenge\nGrill Jon and see what happens. Create conflict. People may drop their act, Jon may have a spergout, it will generate some content. Right now everyone is sitting on the couch doing nothing when they could have had a Jon confrontation that would lead to something. The challenge can go fuck itself, these people need to connect and interact and do something, not sit on the couch and do an occasional beeping noise or just have crutches on the ground.\nThere is no point in pretending to be a cripple if you're not crawling up stairs to go have a serious conversation with Jon while looking like an idiot.",

TTS about him being censored was just evening the playing field. \n>b-b-but he gets special privileges\nEveryone goes downstairs when stressed, everyone makes requests from Jet and has them fulfilled. \n>b-b-but he gets away with not participating in challenges\nSo he never wins any fisbucks. In fact he's treated the worst because both challenges that he won didn't even count (the skit challenge elimination immunity was ignored, he didn't receive anything for winning Hyde and Seek II). He even had both hands taped in the cooking challenge when everyone else only had one hand taped. They fucked him over on the hot dog challenge knowing he was reluctant to eat pork. \n>b-b-but they show him favoritism\nHe was kicked in the face, humiliated by being told to wear a helmet all the time, repeatedly singled out by sharks until he literally began intimidating them, they even tried to force Jetty by putting him in a room with Letty alone twice.\nJon has been through the wringer, \n\nIf anything Josie is the most privileged. The producers literally NEVER fuck with her and constantly play into her le quirky girl stuff.",
