The only two defenses Sam Hyde has is proving that Simmons did anything and just hoping that courts don't care and dismiss the trial.\nThere are a lot of people who would be willing to bankroll his legal expenses to dunk on Sam Hyde.",

There's usually three subsects of the online chinkoid: the griefer, the retard, and the isolationists. \nYou encountered the isolationists.\n\nSome are completely self-aware and cognizant of the stereotypes. Others are unironic souless bugmen. So instead of retaliation, they wait until you get bored and leave; if not they just log off and try again later. They follow the teachings of Confucius to the letter.\n\nA more recent example I can think of is in Foxhole. On the Warden side there was a huge chink clan that did major operations, because they had a fuckload of members. They kept getting sabotaged by the same side and people openly called them slurs whenever they saw them. Instead of retaliating with a huge griefing operation, they switched sides.\n\n>>183868828\nThey are the cattle that the elites in China domesticated successfully over the years of dysgenics.",

That's like a pedophile!\" because of false equivalent age range bullshit.\n\nI'm 29, I've learned a lot of shit and developed in my 20s, but not in any way like my development from when I was 10 to twenty.

Like seriously imagine having to be Vance and not only sit in that chair while Simmons flaunts his disgusting body in front of you, Letty's slutty dress barely concealing his raging erection and emaciated body, and just sit there, joke after joke, minute after minute, while he perfected that sissy voice. Not only having to tolerate his monstrous fucking visage but his haughty attitude as everyone on in the tank tells him he's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, SIMONE LOOKS LIKE THAT?? because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch his ugly fucking mongoloid face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been doing fucking nothing but sitting and standing and later practice swinging for your FISHTANK CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Washington. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the cum leaking out of his swollen sissy cock as he tucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to sit there and revel in his \"improv (for that is what he calls it)\" skills, the skills he worked so hard for with Letty in the previous days. And then Letty calls for another circumcision joke, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the sharks could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Vance. You're not going to lose your $10,000 over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.",

It comes with the edited documentary they'll release after it's over as well which I'm interested in but I wouldn't say it's worth a full $40 for that alone.

College was like extended high school but with more trauma and nonstop retail work and didn't end until I was 26 due to administrations scamming me out of transfer credits and having to switch majors. I didn't graduate a more mature person, just exhausted and burnt out. Someone else my age at the time would have been a shitty match, probably having already had 4 years of work experience and a healthy salary, while I needed a few years of not working anymore to recharge so I didn't anhero.\n\nThe phases of life argument is just classist bullshit bc feminism is handed down from the top.",

He never said anything about banging Letty, I think he just meant that sharing a room with her would look bad, but this guy is a serial deceiver. His girlfriend speech was literally just to hype himself up as a good guy protagonist, it was weak drama. He probably thinks it was brilliant too. Maybe it was since people unironically bought it.",
