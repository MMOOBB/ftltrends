Or when participants are expected to give genuine answers they start trolling because they know how to respond to Sam's \"gaslighting\".\n\nWasn't the entire purpose to bring in people who have no idea what they're getting into?

Maybe it's because I've only lived in the south and midwest US, but girls like Letty are exceedingly rare on dating apps. 95% of women on dating apps have no interests, hobbies, or personality. All they talk about is traveling, drinking margaritas, and being \"foodies\". They irrationally talk about how they're attracted to tattoos. They also follow all the same normie shit apparently because they all use the same fucking jokes on their bios. And the 5% that aren't like that? 90% of those are obese. I fucking hate women.

He's even changed his profile to read \"josiebros archnemesis\" so I have no doubt he is under the assumption they are still dating. From what I can tell they have been \"dating\" for 4 or so years. I reckon >>184466491 is right on the money though, her new found confidence might be giving her second thoughts.\n\n> Know all those crazy tweets about wanting to start again and have new chances? She was already dating him back then.\nThis is pretty damning, unless you interpret that tweet as being about friends and nkt romantic relationships.",
