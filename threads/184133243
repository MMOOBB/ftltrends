Refusing to take part, like Jon did, was the only morally correct thing to do. Even then, regardless of the morality of the decision, the reality that this will be on the internet forever means that if any of these people hope to have a half decent job in their lives (though I suppose that is where I am not comprehending their situation properly) then they will struggle to do so.\nNot only that, but Jon has had people calling him a retard probably his entire life.
