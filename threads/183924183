All she would need to do is make a massive deal out of that, anyone who tried to brush it off as not a big deal and Jon being socially unaware she could just respond to with \"wow I'm being touched inappropriately and you're downplaying it and defending the culprit\" and the producers would be forced to act. Plus the jokes he made about sending her shit pics and stuff she could make out to be him making \"inappropriate sexual comments\" about her. Vance would absolutely join in and be like \"yeah, thats really weird\", Damiel already doesn't like Jon so he would just go along with it, Sylvia and Josie would both just crack under the social pressure \n\nSpending literally any time around a BPD girl is giving them all the ammo they need to ruin your fucking life",
