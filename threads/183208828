E.g., from a Swiss survey: 30% of men, but NOT ONE out of 1,000 surveyed women (0%!) have paid for sex.\n\nFake scam dating ads almost exclusively target straight men: strong evidence of higher male libido.\n\nThere are now roughly 70 MILLION excess men in China and India who will live and die without partners, according to surveys.\n\nTinder usage is correlated with lower self-esteem for men but not women.\n\nAverage women receive 15 times as many matches as average men on Tinder.\n\nMost online dating sites are dominated by men: only 21% of Tinder users are female.\n\nWomen are statistically more attracted to men who are already in relationships than single men.\n\nWomen's average reported sex partner counts DOUBLE when they're connected to a polygraph (lie detector).\n\nHalf of women surveyed who were currently in a relationship reported having a \"backup\" partner in their social circle.\n\nMen are 8x more likely than women to regret passing up casual sex (28.9% M, 3.6% F); i.e., women have higher action regret, while men have higher inaction regret.\n\nAccording to a trial by Fisher (2012), published in the Journal of Sex Research, men think about sex on average 34 times a day, while women thought about sex 19 times a day, i.e. men on average think 1.8 times as often about sex.\n\nMen reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and when asked to estimate the actual frequency of their experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week).",

Moreover, all men aged 20 to 60 mainly desire youth and good looks, while the relative proportion of old men is growing due to falling birth rates (which means an aging overall population) and a slightly higher birth rate of males. Hence, lots of men compete for few fertile, sexually available and young women.\n\nWomen rapidly lose interest in sex once in a stable relationship or living with a man. Conversely, male sexual desire was found to remain constant, or even increased throughout the course of the relationship.\n\nThe more men love their wife, the more they want to have sex with their wife. The more women loved their husbands, the LESS they wanted to have sex with those husbands.\nMen showed affection by initiating sex, sharing leisure activities, and doing housework with their wives. By contrast, women showed affection by reducing negative or antagonistic behaviors (e.g nagging less and being less annoying).",
