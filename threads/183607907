Just as loud when they speak and do shit and one that will not shut the fuck up unless you physically remove yourself from him and does not recognize when you don't want to talk. The fucked thing is they're just dumb but not malicious and just want you to be their friend but their existence is grating after 20 minutes because i can't stand naturally loud people and you can tell they're lying to you in an effort to make themselves better in some way. They are the purest definition of steam of consciousness because everything that they say is as it comes. You'll never see them get stuck in the middle of a sentence for a second and try to figure out how exactly they want to form what it is they're trying to say to get the point across as concisely as possible. \nIf jon would just not lie and not be obnoxiously loud at all times, I think he would be much more favorably looked on and the worst they would fuck with him is making him say words funny. If it weren't for the speech impediment, I think him being overbearing would have gotten checked more growing up and most likely made him a much more sociable person. Instead people just quietly leave him, and he never truly solidifies why people do this.",

The Fishtank website will be down for a while, and it's all because of a silly cookie incident.\n\nYou see, my buddy Sam stole my cookies the other day and I cried really hard because of it. I know it sounds childish, but those cookies were special to me. I've been trying to find them ever since, and that's why I haven't had time to work on the website.\n\nI'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but I hope you understand that sometimes, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. And in this case, what I gotta do is find my cookies.\n\nBut don't worry, I won't rest until those cookies are back in my possession and the Fishtank website is up and running again. I appreciate your patience and your support during this difficult time.\n\nThanks again for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJet Neptune",
