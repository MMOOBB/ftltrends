Josie is stale and yesterday's news.\n>>b-b-but Sam hates Letty!!!\nNot true. She's his second favorite after Jon. He was impressed by her toughness and ability to survive Frank.

Everyone is forced to wear white tunics and footwraps and they have to fight in the arena to pay off their debts. They must eat grits and bread all day and only use port o'potty. Garage is now the Colosseum - there's a new fight every hour and attendance is mandatory. each fighter picks a weapon. \n\nBen is the gladiator slave owner named Solonius who whips his gladiators into shape. Chris is the Emperor and takes bed slaves and the gladiators must cook and feed him and fan him. When they're not fighting in the arena they are working out in the living room. Emperor Chris & TTS decides the loser's punishment. whoever gets 3 victories = they earn their freedom and can buy land (one of the rooms upstairs).",
