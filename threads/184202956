I've met Josie material there before.\nFrom personal experience, in a high density area there are girls *similar* to Josie at a rate of: 0.4 to 0.8 per square mile (I'm being a little more conservative, because for my first calculations I used 0.8 per square mile in my area).\nAgain, this number is based on experience from girls I've known that were actually similar to Josie in mannerisms, interests, style, and many of her cute quirks. All within around 20 square miles of me. That's how I got these rates per square mile.\nThis doesn't factor in race. I've only known white girls, Hapa girls, Asian girls, and Latina girls that act in any way similar to all her qualities. But it does factor in age ranges.\nSo lets use Los Angeles as an example:\n>469 square miles in LA county\n>rate of around 0.4 per square mile\n>187.6 girls similar to Josie in LA county\nWe can now take that number and find the rate per standard population:\n>population of LA country:\n>18,500,000 people live in LA country as of 2021\n>18,500,000 / 100,000\n>185\n>187.6 / 185 = 1.014\nFor every 100,000 people ANYWHERE in the USA, maybe even in many places of the world, there is likely to be at least 1 girl similar to Josie. Finding her at the correct local DDR spots is the real trick.\nJosie is a very unique girl.\nHope this was a whitepill for you anons that there is hope to find a girl *similar* to Josie.\nDo with this information what you will anons.....",
