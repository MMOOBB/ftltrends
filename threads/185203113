This is so half assed and they clearly have no idea what they're doing, it's just happening to produce kino because these people are developing cabin fever and Chris has schizophrenia. It'd be like if we trapped Terry Davis in with a bunch of monkeys and a camera, it's natural kino. The fact that they've repeatedly rigged the games for Letty despite her playing with literal poop, or the fact that they got rid of Betty when I literally didn't do half of what Letty did.\n\nIt's just pathetic at this point.",
