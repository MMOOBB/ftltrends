(you guys must admit at least some of it is)\nthe show seems very asinine. what is the overall point of it all? \nis it actually some kind of therapy for the autists in the audience disguised as a reality show? \n(i noticed a lot of mk ultra techniques in the first two weeks. especially when jon was still around. i imagine watching that shit constantly while being sleep deprived must be wild. also the sound of the TTS feels very pavlovian.)",

The piece can be anything - a painting, drawing, sculpture, object but also accompanied with a description explaining the background of the piece. Contestant with the most creative (ideally absurd) piece and explanation wins.

Give fishes time to plan and prepare like the comedy skit in their free time. But we're three weeks in with this shit, I doubt this will happen.",

There's no hard rules, they don't stick to timelines, nothing is planned or thought out, they're just winging it. So nothing works and nobody takes the show or its games/challenges seriously. \nEven just now, they had this rule, \"If someone gives you two water bottles, they HAVE to do what you say.\" But then Letty used these rules and Jet made up a new rule \"Oh Josie can just counter that by also giving water bottles.\" \nThere's a house full of people who want to scheme, cheat, and form alliances, but they can't do it because none of the rules make enough sense to be played around.",

It really looks like she's desperate to fit in with who she sees as \"the cool kid\" in the house. I just watched the first \"Josie gets a plushie video\" from April 25, and she even talks differently now to how she did 2 weeks ago, not to mention her clothing, which has gotten significantly more \"niggerish\" and baggy. Seeing her bathroom confessionals against the first week or two is honestly jarring.\nPretty sad to see. Hope she drops the wigger act, but considering she'll probably be hanging out with Damiel after this I doubt this will be going away any time soon.\nHonestly feel bad for her boyfriend if this is the case. She seems like a total 180 of the girl he was dating (DDR, going to fucking furry conventions etc) before she went into the house.\nWho knows. Maybe I'm just retarded and overthinking it, but from what I have seen of Josie's online footprint so far, this feels like an aberration and a turn for the worse.",

It really looks like he is desperate to fit in with who he sees as \"the cool jew\" in the house. I just watched the first \"Jet gets josie a plushie twitter post\" from April 25, and he even talks differently now to how he did 2 weeks ago, not to mention his clothing, which has gotten significantly more \"jewish\" and baggy. Seeing his bathroom usage against the first week or two is honestly jarring.\nPretty sad to see. Hope he drops the jew act, but considering she'll probably be hanging out with Bic after this I doubt this will be going away any time soon.\nHonestly feel bad for his dad if this is the case. He seems like a total 180 of the boy he was raising (world corp, going to fucking rap conventions etc) before he went into the house.\nWho knows. Maybe I'm just retarded and overthinking it, but from what I have seen of Jet\u2019s online footprint so far, this feels like an aberration and a turn for the worse.",
