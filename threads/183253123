That's not his fault at all and pretty much everything he's ever made has way more thought put into it than just screaming random words (outside of like really early throwaway youtube video shitposts). You would think based off of his comedy that his fanbase would actually not be the kind to just scream random words and sabotage projects but the only thing they understood about his entire career was that he's this epic based man who will say anything, completely ignoring the actual comedy part of his material where he has thought out jokes and setup.",

They had a plan, way after the legal shit was over, till the trailer which was the other day, and when it's time to rumble they realize that they can't really pull it off cause they feel bad and because their shit plan costs them too much money to risk anything. They constantly say, \"We didn't plan for over 5k viewers\" That's an average stream, this is an event that the entire internet has been excited for, being pushed by every edgy e-celeb, and that started right after a bunch of attention on Sam from fucking around in Creator Clash 2.

He has without a doubt toned down his comedy, but it waits to be seen if he has anything in store that will come close to what was presented in the past. \nAs for hard work... no. He got lucky that idubbbz was coming by to make a hit piece on him and he was just smart enough to recognize it for what it was and to play it in such a way that made idubbbz come off as deranged. Not hard at all, Ian IS deranged and has a room-temperature IQ. But it was a smart move, I'll give him that. \nNo one has been trying to censor him out of the mainstream, they already did that. He wasn't under further attack until icuckzzz decided to come and pick at Sam's carcass like the faggot vulture he is. Which ultimately was a good thing for Sam because by outplaying Ian the simpleton he was able to expose himself to a bigger audience and come off smelling like roses. The problem is that the audience he was exposed to are all fatherless zoomers and now he makes his nut giving life advice that ranges from sensible to completely retarded. I haven't laughed at something he's made in a long time, Nick is the only one in the crew making me crack a smile these days.",

Nothing Sam is making now comes close to the old stuff. I didn't want his comedy to change, and I'm not trying to make it change now. It already did change. He went from phone videos, skits, public stand-up, and trolling ops to doing a low-energy podcast, giving bad life advice to lonely men, and financing shitty projects like fishtank. I would love it if fishtank recovered from this coddling, tailspin bullshit, I would love it if WP2 was actually good. But neither is likely to happen and you spending your time tirelessly defending Sam is not going to change his trajectory. I never even said his stuff was offensive just that it has been toned down. You can't even follow a basic conversation. You are completely brain-broken and delusional and for whatever reason you think falsely claiming that you were some kind of ground floor fan means anything when your statements directly contradict that supposed knowledge. \nI'm done with you, you've been wrung out for all the retardation you can currently provide without ending up repeating yourself.",
