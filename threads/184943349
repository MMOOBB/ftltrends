                "comment": ">The Milgram experiment(s) on obedience to authority figures were a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, 40 men in the age range of 20 to 50 from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a \"learner\". These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real.[2]\n\n>The experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of subjects would fully obey the instructions, with every participant going up to 300 volts, and 65% going up to the full 450 volts. Milgram first described his research in a 1963 article in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology[1] and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View.[3]",

                "comment": ">The Stanford prison experiment (SPE) was a psychological experiment conducted in the summer of 1971. It was a two-week simulation of a prison environment that examined the effects of situational variables on participants' reactions and behaviors. Stanford University psychology professor Philip Zimbardo led the research team who administered the study.[1]\n\n>Participants were recruited from the local community with an ad in the newspapers offering $15 per day to male students who wanted to participate in a \"psychological study of prison life.\" Volunteers were chosen after assessments of psychological stability, and then randomly assigned to being prisoners or prison guards.[2] Critics have questioned the validity of these methods.[3]\n\n>Those volunteers selected to be \"guards\" were given uniforms specifically to de-individuate them, and instructed to prevent prisoners from escaping. The experiment officially started when \"prisoners\" were arrested by real Palo Alto police. Over the following five days, psychological abuse of the prisoners by the \"guards\" became increasingly brutal. After psychologist Christina Maslach visited to evaluate the conditions, she was upset to see how study participants were behaving and she confronted Zimbardo. He ended the experiment on the sixth day.[4]\n\n>SPE has been referenced and critiqued as one of the most unethical psychology experiments in history. The harm inflicted on the participants prompted universities worldwide to improve their ethics requirements for human subjects of experiments to prevent them from being similarly harmed. Other researchers have found it difficult to reproduce the study, especially given those constraints.[5] Critics have described the study as unscientific and fraudulent.[6][7]",

Personality trait psychologists believe that a person's personality is relatively consistent across situations. Situationists, opponents of the trait approach, argue that people are not consistent enough from situation to situation to be characterized by broad personality traits. The debate is also an important discussion when studying social psychology, as both topics address the various ways a person could react to a given situation.",

Mischel argued that in his literature review of personality research, the correlation between personality and behavior, or behavior across situations, rarely exceeded .30-.40. Because the correlations are close to zero, Mischel concluded that personality traits have little to no relationship to shaping behavior. This claim was especially detrimental to personality psychology and continues to haunt many fields of psychology research today.",

These impacts vary from low self-esteem in the audience (Peek & Beresin, 2015), to the humiliation of reality television participants. The impact of reality television on contemporary culture has always been clear to the public in general, but television displays its negative impacts as irrelevant. Reality television communicates highly unethical values and it is corrupting to society because of the way it manipulates reality. The influences of reality television can be separated into three main areas; impacts of reality television on participants, which is the damage originated behind the screen that involves humiliation of participants (Mast, 2016). Then, we have the effect of reality television on viewers, which transmits unethical values to the audience and induces the acceptance of immoral acts. The last point ate the negative impacts of reality television on society and this occurs television affects not only its participants and viewers but also the society in general. By making the audience accept a new perspective on actions, the viewers transmit the values learned to those around them.",

Reality shows force participants to reveal personal information and socialise in a non-spontaneous way, manipulating the nature of social interaction. In most reality television shows, participants are required to reveal personal information early on in the show. If more intimate information is revealed in the beginning, the participants are more likely to be admired by the audience; this forces participants to change their normal behaviour. According to Mast (2016), the main unethical treatment of participants consists of the intrusion and humiliation of reality television members. Reality shows have access to the private life of a participant. This means that reality television shows expose participants\u2019 private thoughts, feelings, and ideas to the audience, violating the basic human right of privacy. The humiliation of the individual is another factor in the unethical treatment of members. In reality television \u201cacts of humiliation broadly consist of performing actions or creating conditions that lower a person\u2019s or group\u2019s dignity or self-esteem, with the perpetrator, often deriving a sense of self-satisfaction from it by feeling above the other.\" Humiliation displays participants as weak and exposes them to the social pressure of people watching them on television. Another factor that proves that reality television shows are unethical is the psychological issues that arise in participants. A person\u2019s mental state will define how their reaction when they find themselves in stressful situations, which proves that when casting interviews fail to identify certain traits, the pressure might outset psychological issues.",

The negative influence of television does not only reach its watchers but also everyone around them. Reality shows are highly unethical and corrupting to society because of the highly unethical and immoral values that it shares to the public. Alcohol and illegal drug use, violence and crime are depicted as ordinary and exciting.According to studies, the negative impacts of reality television have a more significant influence on younger viewers. \n>These consequences might have a greater impact on them because during younger ages it is harder to differentiate on moral and immoral acts. As people who grow up watching reality television shows turn older, the unethical values learned in their youth develop further to become part of their personality. A very important theory that relates to the negative impacts of reality television on society is the cultivation theory. Which means that people who watch television over a long period, tend to associate the false reality displayed on television to the real world. This theory claims that \u201cheavy viewers are more likely to accept the world as created by television as an accurate depiction of reality and to use it as a reference frame in their day-to-day life.\". People who watch reality television more often will take the values learned from television and then use those values around others.",

Reality television shows do not consider morality when it comes to the treatment of its participants. Television shows manipulate their viewers to learn unethical values to corrupt the viewer and make a profit from the crowds. Society seems affected at large when reality television viewers take on practice immoral attitudes transmitted by television and pass them on to others around them in their day-to-day life. Television is a powerful tool used to communicate to a great number of people, but reality television shows can have a big negative influence on the future of society.",

If sam only wanted money he should take a hint from the show and start grabbing girls off shortbusses or centers for abuse, get them to stream on twitch or something, buy their equipment and have them chew on toys or stim in front of the cameras or whatever while guys throw money at them. The damaged ones also won't be as good at negotiating contracts so he could take like 50% or more of their earnings and keep it all good and legal. If I had the money to throw around I'd do it myself tbqh.",
