I\u2019ve already bought her 3 of those, cause I\u2019m not a NEET loser like y\u2019all. I have money to spend so I may as well use it to make my love, Josie, happy. Idk what it is about Josie but like I don\u2019t even want to have sex with her. I just want to hold her tight and kiss her and love her and be nice to her and please her and fulfil her every wish. she\u2019s just so amazing, not perfect but it\u2019s actually a good thing she\u2019s not perfect. the autism she has is both cute and intriguing. I don\u2019t want to sexualize her, I just want to talk with her, game with her, sleep call with her, play vrchat with her, go to the arcade with her, hold her hand and just be around her. she\u2019s just perfect.",

You have no money. You have no job. You are so morbidly obese that you can't even physically do most work. You're so unhealthy that you will probably be dead in a few years even if you somehow survived homelessness. You are stuck in a house with some other spergs in what will be the last notoriety you will ever experience. You've said fuck it and gone fully nude since you have nothing else to lose at this point. You've desperate tried to have sex with the ugly women there and they all rejected you.\n\nDo you think a man like this is in a stable state of mind? It's incredibly risky for Sam and Jet to keep him there as the possibility that he sexually assaults a female contestant or kills himself on camera before the end of it seems extremely high.",

So autistic she takes everything at face value. Is a cutter, stimms to not rip out her hair, fetishizes white cock and breaking guy's hearts. Femcel act is a lie - has plenty of friends & goes to cons. Likes nigger culture & when she is calm acts like one. The uwu smoll girl act is a lie/coping tactic when nervous. Would hate her fanbase irl. mentally ill /soc/ coomer that pretended to be 40 years old while being underage on plebbit. Has no internal monologue & follows the crowd when it comes to group think.\n\n>Letty, looks weird. has toxic traits that will guarantee a psycho will stalk her out of revenge (happened twice.) Has a fucked up leg that's longer than the other one, & a fucked up eye. She gets off to manipulating people & from making people mad and/or being yelled at in small doses (Damiel proves this limit). Enjoys trying to sissfy and demean men. Doesn't know how to do basic self care because her parents do it for her. Is a drug addict & a discord neet. Has anorexia. She rarely shits because of ensure (low calorie liquid meal for elderly people.) fascinated with poop due to the infrequency of pooping she does. (Piss fetish unconfirmed due to it being a meme status) Has a hairy beaver & gives boring head. Is also a cutter.\n\n>Sylvia is fat, boring, & blacked. Used to be addicted to drugs. Is thin skinned, a hypocrite, & nasty (Either wiped her ass with Lettie's clothes or smeared period blood). Shit talks everyone behind their backs (she does it the most ) Has gone to jail more than once this year alone. Has an OF, & has pissed on people for money. Sold her body for sex. Her outfits look ridiculous & wears makeup like a clown. White trash. Is probably a cutter. Is on antipsychotics. Has shitty tats.\n\nPeople really have waifu wars over these girls? I'm disappointed /tv/..",

You literally have to put in effort to get fat, but not getting that fat involved doing absolutely nothing at all.\nAnd when confronted with this, fat fucking bastards will make up every lie and excuse in the world as to why it isn't actually their fault.\n\nUnless someone tied you down and force fed you until you became that fat, it is your fault and your excuses just show how disgusting you actually are as a person.",

It only seems easy to you because you've fucking spent years training yourself to do it.\n\nYou know what? I can't lift heavy as fuck weights. Yet bodybuilders make it look easy.

Exposing general internet audience to niche degenerates and lolcows probably ought to be more profitable than it has been so far, \"You control the action!\" has been undercooked, and themed radical environment changes - like camping - need to be happening all of the time.

This season was saved by casting and Simmons Streissand effect (and waifu simulator)",
