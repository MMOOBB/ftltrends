He kept sending her sex letters and following her and she dropped out of the school it was so bad.\nThese are the unintended consequences of autism. Does Chris do this? Yes. \nAsking Letty for a kiss, while being completely naked and cornering her over and over in every bedroom of the house was bad enough.

I respect him for that. \n\nHe even said afterwards in his room there are some things more important than money. He's really a good guy and I think Josie is really a good girl. That's why they'd make the best finalists. Meanwhile Letty is just sitting there not participating throwing shit on them and taping weights to Vance. Sure it's epic style content but it's a lot less interesting than two honorable enduring warriors with respect for one another going at it.\n\nThat and the fact they actually like each other makes it an interesting dynamic, whereas Josie and Vance both dislike Letty.",
