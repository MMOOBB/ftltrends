I don't even really watch, more keep it in the background and once I see everyone sperging out in the threads I'll open it up, lol. Looking at it from the outside I can see it being pretty fucking weird though.",

I look at people watching this shit with the same fascination as people who watch legacy Boomer Media. Reality TV died at some point in the last decade with a whimper and the people defending this show are trying to convince me it's a unique experience. I was of voting age in 2000 I was there when Big Brother was topping the charts, when my classmates tuned in every single night to discuss who would leave the house. Sammy can be a renegade auteur comedian making underground projects but he has nothing on the masters of goyslop entertainment.",
