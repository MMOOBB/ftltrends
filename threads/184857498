                "comment": "To the person in last thread asking if the challenges will get better. Doubt it. \nThey have resorted to forcing/gaslighting/intimidating Letty to being sexually touched by a fat retarded. Sam is basically Letty\u2019s boss and telling her \u201cyou have to\u201d get a back massage from fatty and flirt with him. I don\u2019t believe most of these metoo claims but you can\u2019t ignore it when it\u2019s on video. They are scrambling for ideas. Hence why Sam came back today doing his boxing gimmic. It\u2019s all he has to offer.",

If you empathize with the characters too deeply you feel a lot of the anxiousness and dread that they would feel, but also a lot of the excitement.\n\nThere is one thing that is pretty unique to media, it reminds me of being in discord calls, where someone pretty intelligent is \"up to something\" talking directly to someone with far away metaphors and such, trying to undermine their psyche. It's not a a gaslight, more like some kind of psychic attack. There is a fair bit of this going on in the show, but I think contestants like Vance, Josie, and Letty are capable of seeing through 90% of these things. I don't know about Sylvia, maybe 60/40, 50/50. The contestants dropped thusfar were not capable of seeing through most.",

First mini challenge of the day was to clean the house and who ever worked the hardest got a fish buck. idk who won the fish buck I think they've just given them all to chris so he probably got that one too. Who ever acts the blackest gets 2 fish bucks its based on who ever gets the most clips uploaded of them acting \"gangsta\" on twitter. letty and chris are bloods and vance, josie, and sylvia are crips. Josie and Letty being the leaders of their respective parties. Not much has really happened today besides the Chris backrub shit with letty. where she was trying to give Chris a backrub but he went to get a shower or something and she heard him say something or something idk production was trying to kind of get them to fuck but ben came up and put a stop to it.",
