And on that note, is it even his religion? Letty had to tell him what Psalms was.\nI mean he had a mental breakdown when Simmons spoke critically of Andrew Tate. He often instigates conflicts when anyone is critical of him or things he enjoys. It's his way or the highway to the rest degree, so much so that the producers have even began to treat him preferentially. \nWhat are his redeemable qualities? His voice gets old fast and his tard antics are only enjoyable so many times. Only days ago the audience was more than happy to see Sam beat the fuck out of him on a nightly basis. People told him how they really felt over TTS. But now Sam tells the audience he's had a rough time and to lay off of him and suddenly they do. Idiots, I swear.",
